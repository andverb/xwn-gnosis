Choose a different Skill (not Magic). - After Creation, instead of Foci raising Skills by tiers, Foci grant 3 Skill Points towards future purchase of the Skills next tier. - After Creation, Foci can raise Skills past PC Level Caps. Skill+4 Max. @ Skill+4 choose another Skill to apply Points towards. - A Warrior Foci is any the GM deems. An Expert Foci is any the GM deems. Foci list: ALERT Level 1: Gain Notice. Can't be surprised. Immune to Execution attacks. Roll w/ Advantage for Initiative. Level 2: You always act 1st in the combat Round unless another also has Alert. ARMORED MAGIC Level 1: You can use spells or arts while wearing armor whose Encumbrance is ≤ 2. You can use a shield while casting, provided your other hand is empty for gesturing. Level 2: You can cast spells while wearing armor of any Encumbrance. You can cast w/ both hands full, but not bound. ARMSMASTER (Not applicable to unarmed or non-thrown weapons. Doesn't stack w/ other Foci that add a Skills level to damage or Shock.) Level 1: Gain Stab. Ready a Stowed melee or thrown weapon as an Instant Action. Add your Stab Skill level to a melee or thrown weapon's damage roll or Shock damage (assuming it has any). Level 2: Shock from your melee attacks always treats the target as AC 10. +1 bonus to hit w/ all thrown or melee attacks. ARTISAN Create Mods even if you are not an Expert. Level 1: Gain Craft. Your Craft Skill is treated as 1 level higher (max of +5) for purposes of crafting & maintaining Mods. Mods you build require 1 fewer unit of arcane salvage (min of 1). Craft any profession's work w/o penalty. Level 2: 1st Mod added to item requires no Maintenance & ½ the typical silver cost (this benefit stacks w/ masterwork 1st Mod benefit). You auto succeed to build masterwork gear, & 1/month you can reduce a created Mod's salvage cost by 1 further unit (min of 0). ASSASSIN Level 1: Gain Sneak. Conceal an object no larger than a knife from anything less than a strip search. Draw this object as an On Turn Action, & your point-blank thrown or melee attacks made during a surprise Round w/ it can't miss. Level 2: You can take a Move Action the same Round you make an Execution attack. You may split the Movement when making an Execution attack to before & after the attack. This movement is too quick to alert a victim or be hindered by guards. AUTHORITY Level 1: Gain Lead. 1/day make a request of an NPC who is not openly hostile to you, rolling a Cha/Lead Skill check @ a DC = to the NPC's Morale score. On success they will comply, provided the request is not very harmful or highly uncharacteristic. Level 2: Any NPC being directly led by you gains a Morale & hit roll bonus = to your Lead Skill & a +1 bonus on all Skill checks. Your followers & henchmen will not act against your interests unless under extreme pressure. BERSERKER (CUPOFCOFFE HB) (Only Warriors or Partial Warriors can take this Focus.) Level 1: 1/Combat, you may enter a fury as a Move Action, & end it as an On Turn Action. While in the fury you can choose to make your attack & damage rolls w/advantage, however until the start of your next turn, foes roll attack & damage w/ advantage against you. You are immune to mental effects that would alter your emotions while in the fury. Level 2: When dropped to 0 HP for the 1st time in the fury, you may continue to fight for a # of Rounds = to either Stab or Punch before falling Mortally Wounded. Additional damage taken during this time (shy of catastrophic) can't stop or kill you. If healed during this time, you stabilize, but the ability's benefits end. CLOSE COMBATANT Level 1: Gain any combat Skill. You can use knife-sized thrown weapons in melee w/o suffering penalties for the proximity of melee attackers. You ignore Shock damage from melee assailants, even if you're unarmored @ the time (invoking this benefit disrupts any spellcasting you might do that Round due to the need for violently active evasion). (Still susceptible to Shock from Swarm attacks) Level 2: The Shock damage from your melee attacks treats all targets as if they were AC 10. The Fighting withdrawal combat Act is treated as an On Turn Action for you & can be performed freely. CONNECTED Level 1: Gain Connect. If you've spent ≥ a week in a not-entirely-hostile location, you'll have built a web of contacts willing to do favors for you that are ≤ mildly illegal. You can call on 1 favor per game day & the GM decides how far they'll go for you. Level 2: 1/session, if not entirely implausible, you meet someone you know who is willing to do modest favors for you. You can decide when & where to meet this person, but the GM decides who they are & what they can do for you. CULTURED Level 1: Gain Connect.

Multiple Instants resolve in order GM decides. Common Combat Actions MAKE AN ATTACK (Main Action): Melee a foe w/in range or shoot a foe w/ a Ranged attack using a Readied weapon. CAST A SPELL (Main Action): If the caster has taken damage that Round, drawn or sheathed an item w/ their casting hand, or been badly jostled they can't take this Action. If damage is taken while casting the spell fizzles & the spell slot is wasted. USE A SKILL (Main Action): Perform a Skill that can be done in 6 secs (stabilize a wounded ally, turn a crank…) READY/STOW AN ITEM (Main Action): Draw a weapon or item from a pack. Changes from Readied to Stowed, or vice versa. SWARM ATTACK (Main Action): - Each willing attacker takes this Act, targeting a foe w/in range. - Once the final attacker has acted, 1 of the assailants makes an immediate attack (+2 to hit & +1 to damage for each additional assailant. Max +6/+3). Damage can't exceed the max of their normal attack, & is not applied to Shock. - Even on a miss, Shock from the attack always harms the target regardless of their AC, if they're using a shield, or they have a Foci immunity to Shock. Total Defense however can prevent this Shock damage. SHOVE (Main Action): Roll to hit. On success, no damage but roll an opposed Str/Punch or Str/Exert check. On success, the attacker chooses whether the opponent falls prone or is knocked back 10'. SHATTER A SHIELD (Main Action): Requires an axe, mace, Foci-improved unarmed attack… Roll to hit. Success = no damage, but roll an opposed Str/Stab check (+1 to defender). Success = shield breaks. Magic shields are immune. Craft-0 & 1 scene to repair. GRAPPLE A FOE (Main Action): - Roll to hit w/ Punch. On success, no damage, but roll an opposed Str/Punch check. On success the target is grappled. - While grappled, neither attackers or defender can move from their spot, nor can they fight w/ anything but unarmed attacks. - To escape a grapple: defender uses Main Action & rolls 1 opposed Str/Punch check & compares it vs each grappling attacker. - At the end of each Round the defender remains grappled they take damage as if hit w/ a Punch attack from each grappling foe. - If a target is larger than the attacker: attacker suffers -2 to the Grapple Check, or -4 for creatures barely plausible to Grapple. - To move a grappled foe: attacker spends Main Action & rolls an opposed Str/Punch check. Success = target is moved 10' along w/ them, or thrown 5' & knocked prone. Failure = Defender breaks free. FIGHTING WITHDRAWAL (Main Action): Disengage from foes w/in melee range, preventing free attacks. You still must Move. CHARGE (Main & Move Action): Requires min of 10' to build momentum. Move x2 normal Movement Speed in a straight line before making a melee or thrown attack @ +2 to hit. After the attack, the attacker suffers -2 to AC for the rest of the Round. RUN (Move Action): Move normal combat movement, typically 30'. ½ speed to crawl, climb, swim, difficult terrain… SCREEN AN ALLY (Move Action): - PC selects an ally w/in 10' to Screen until the PC's next turn. - While screened, ranged/melee attackers attempting to hit the screened target must succeed an opposed Str or Dex Check using the combat Skill of their weapon vs the screener's weapon Skill. On failure, the attack roll is directed towards the screening PC. - A PC can screen a # of attackers = to their Combat Skill. A PC w/ < Skill+1 can't effectively screen. SNAP ATTACK (Instant Action): attack outside your turn. -4 to hit & uses your Main Action for the turn. GM resolves order of multiple snap attacks. Snap attacks are typically reserved for PCs or powerful combatants (No Name = No Snap attacks). TOTAL DEFENSE (Instant Action): Costs Main Action for the Round & can't be used if their Main Action was already used that Round. Avoids all Shock damage & PC gains a +2 bonus to AC until their next turn. CAN prevent Shock from Swarm attack. RELOAD A weapon (Main Action/Move Action/On Turn): - Reload a weapon like a crossbow w/ the Slow Reload property (Main Action). - Reload a weapon like a bow w/ the Reload property untrained or w/o a quiver readied (Move Action). - Reload a weapon like a bow w/ the Reload property w/ Shoot+1 & a readied quiver (On Turn Action).

Foes brought to zero HP can be left alive @ the wielder's discretion. - N: Numerous. 5 of these count as 1 Readied item. - PM: Precisely Murderous. Imposes -1 penalty to the Phys Saves during Execution attacks. x2 damage even on Success. - R: Reload. Costs a Move Action to reload. If the user has ≥ Shoot+1, they can reload as an On Turn Action. - S: Subtle. Easily hidden in ordinary clothing or concealed in jewelry. - SR: Slow Reload. Takes a Main Action to reload. - SS: Single Shot. Takes 10 Rounds to reload. Reloading attempt is spoiled if a foe melees the wielder. - T: Throwable. Can be used in melee or thrown.
