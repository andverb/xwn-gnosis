### Crafting Gear
Crafting Equipment = Costs ½ the item's retail value. Typically requires Craft Skill check.

**Difficulty:**

- Background Item: No Skill check
- Item unrelated to Background: DC7
- Demanding item: DC9
- Specialist item: DC11

**Crafting Time:**

- Torches, Spears, Cloaks, etc: 1Hr
- Clothes, Blunt weapons, leather armor: 1Day
- Blades, Metal armor, Cart: 1wk

**Crafting bonuses:**

- A Craft-0 Assistant = x2 speed
- DC9 Int or Dex Craft check = x2 speed. On failure lose ½ material & gain no speed.

**Additional rules:**

- DC7 Int or Dex Craft check to jury rig something crude but plausible, DC10 check for something more difficult/less plausible.
- Masterwork gear costs x10 retail & x2 time to craft. DC10 Int or Dex Craft check @ end of crafting, on failure item is normal.
- Masterwork weapon: +1 Hit. Masterwork Armor: Normal armor -1Є (min of 1. Not for purposes of Armored Magic foci.)
- The 1st mod added to Masterwork items costs x2 as much in arcane salvage & supplementary costs, but requires no maintenance.

### Gear Modifications & Maintenance
- Adding Mods to gear requires Expert or Partial Expert, ≤ Craft+1, & rare "salvage" material. Takes 1 week x Mod's required level of Craft to install. ½ time w/ Craft-0 Assistant, or if all waking hours are spent working on the mod.
- Mods can Stack, but can't increase attack or damage bonus > +3 or Skill Check bonus > +1.
- Expert/Partial Expert can Maintain a # of Mods = Int + Con Modifiers + (3 x Craft Level). A modification requires maintenance every 24 hrs or it stops working (assumed to be done automatically by an expert/partial expert). If unmaintained for a 1 week item becomes unfit for use. After 1 yr it may become destroyed. Requires 1 hr of work to clean up a maintenance backlog.
