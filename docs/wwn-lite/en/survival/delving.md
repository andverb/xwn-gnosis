### Visibility
A visible target is one who can be seen, or whose exact location is known. If a PC is seen & dives into a 5' bush to hide, they are not immune to ranged attacks assuming their foes are intelligent enough to have object permanence, though the PC may receive a partial cover bonus if the GM is feeling benevolent.

### Lack of Visibility
Should a target become unable to be seen (invisibility spell, a completely opaque smoke screen, pitch darkness) they are unable to be targeted by ranged attacks, melee attacks against them suffer a -4 penalty, & sight based checks against them fail.

### Lights
Torches typically cast a 30' radius & burn for around 6 turns (1hr). Lanterns for 24 turns (4hrs) but burn dimmer & require an additional turn when performing sight based tasks such as searching a room.

### Searching
A PC describes what/how they are searching. If described appropriately they succeed. For items not found by initial description, have the PC w/ best Wis/Notice roll for the PCs. Other PCs can attempt to aid.

### Locks & Traps
DC8 Dex/Sneak or Int/Craft to disarm ≤ good trap/lock (requires 1 turn). If in haste, Main Action @ +2DC. The Dm will do their best to telegraph the danger of the area (bloodstains, dart-sized holes in walls, the smell of death). Players will decide how to proceed, or not, accordingly.

### Time
Rounds = 10 seconds (6 in a min). Dungeon Turns = 10 mins (6 in an hour). Travel turn = 4 Hours (6 in a day).

### Encumbrance (Є)
A PC's absolute Max carrying capacity: Readied items = to ½ Str Score ↓. Stowed items = to full Str Score. Small bulk goods can be bundled (3 counting as 1 item). Requires a Main Action to Ready, Stow, or Unbundle items.

### Dungeon Mapping
- Do not concern yourself w/ EXACT measurements. Mapping is an art, not a science.
- Dungeons are measured in rough 10' squares.
- Hallways are described up to the point of change. So a 30' hallway w/ a turn in the middle could be described as: "The 10' wide hallway runs East 10ft, branches South, & continues on East another 20' before ending at a door."
- Should a room be rectangular, it will be described first by its North-South run, & then its East-West run.
- If a room's shape is more complex, describe it clockwise by the length of its walls beginning & ending @ the point of entry, so a 50'x40' rectangular room could be described as "You enter from a door on the West wall. The West wall runs north 20', turns East & runs 40', turns South & runs 50', turns West & runs 40', then turns North & runs 30' back to where you stand."
- Doors, openings, or other such can be described using winds & half winds, so a 30'x30' square room w/ one door on the West wall, three doors on the North wall, & two doors evenly spaced on the East wall may be described as "There's a door to the West, one to the North Northwest, one to the North, one to the North Northeast, one to the East NorthEast, & one to the East Southeast."
- When in doubt, sketch it out & confirm w/ the GM.

### Encounter Likelihood
- Roll checks every 3 Turns for average dungeons, every 2 if defenses are astir, or every 4 if dormant.
- Hidden areas or concealed chambers unknown to the natives of the site require no check.

**Roll 1d6:**
1. Encounter
2. Signs of the next encounter
3. A resource is unexpectedly depleted
4. Shift (hazards, factions…)
5-6. Free turn

### Encounter Procedure
Roll 1d6 x 10' if distance is uncertain.

- Unless one party would reasonably notice the other & themselves go unnoticed (making noise, carrying light in the dark…) parties make an opposed Wis/Notice check. Winner notices the other party 1st & decides how to act (greet, flee, ambush…).
- If the NPCs' reaction to the party is uncertain, make a Reaction Roll (2d6 + Cha if a PC is in a position to greet the other party).
- The GM will use the fiction to make PCs @ least somewhat aware of the NPCs' disposition.
- If the encounter devolves into combat, roll Initiative (1d8+Dex). NPCs have no modifier unless especially quick. PCs win ties.

### Reaction Rolls
If a creature's disposition is uncertain, make a Reaction Roll (2d6 & consult the table). If a PC is in a position to greet the targets, add their Cha to the roll. GM will make clear the results through narrative.

**Roll 2d6:**
- 2: Max Hostile
- 3-5: Very Hostile
- 6-8: Predictably hostile, friendly, or indifferent
- 9-11: Very friendly
- 12+: Max friendly

*Potential Peaceful Encounter Reactions: NPCs ask for a bribe, back off, ask a favor, offer tribute, socialize…

### Ambushes & Surprise
- Surprise grants a party a full Round to act before Initiative is rolled.
- Stealth ambushes may provide the opportunity to commit an Execution attack if the targets meet the criteria.
- Bewildering ambushes based on a shocking surprise may provoke a Morale check in undisciplined targets (GM's discretion).

### Morale Checks
- If 2d6 > ML score the creature loses the will to fight. PCs do not make Morale checks.
- Foes may be forced to check morale when 1st faced w/ violence, a leader falls, if victory looks hopeless, if terrified…
- Fleeing combatants may drop burdens, beg for mercy, pray to their gods, offer bribes, make a strategic withdrawal…
- Once a side has failed their ML check they're unlikely to re-engage the same foes until the situation has shifted in their favor.

### Fleeing & Escape
If foes pursue (many don't), escapee w/ best Dex/Exert rolls vs fastest pursuer. Successful escapes take ~1 turn & leave escapees in safety. If escapees # < pursuers: +1. Good escape plan: +1. Group w/ slowest member: -2.
