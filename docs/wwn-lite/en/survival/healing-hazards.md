### Mortally Wounded
- PCs @ HP ≤ 0 are Mortally Wounded. They can cry out, crawl a short distance, or take a small action @ GM discretion. Mortally Wounded PCs die in 6 Rounds, or instantly if more damage is taken.
- NPCs die outright @ ≤ 0HP, or can be knocked unconscious should a Less Lethal weapon be used.

### Stabilizing
- Main Action. Int/Heal or Dex/Heal. DC8 + # of Rounds since the target was downed (+2DC w/o medical tools).
- Only 1 ally can attempt to stabilize a target per Round. Others can attempt to aid the check.
- Once stable the target recovers w/ 1 HP after 10 min rest. The PC can act normally thereafter, but gains the Frail condition.

### Frail
- Frail PCs regain 0HP from a Night's Rest nor do they lose Strain, & will die immediately if brought to 0HP again.
- The Frail condition is cured by 1 week of bed rest, or by magical healing. A physician can attempt to remove the Frail condition w/ an hour's work & a DC10 Skill check. They get only 1 chance to do so.

### First Aid
A creature can restore 1d6 + their Heal Skill HP to an ally (No Check required). Each application adds 1 Strain to the target, but can be repeated as often as Strain allows. A single 10 min turn or scene is sufficient to apply as much first aid as desired. First aid works on Frail PCs, but does not remove the Frail condition.

### Magical Healing
A creature healed w/ magic loses any Mortally Wounded or Frail qualities & can rise on their next turn.

### A Night's Rest & Natural Healing
Assuming proper food, water, protection from the elements, & sleep, creatures recover the following after a night's rest (Creatures that are Frail do not recover HP nor lose System Strain this way):

- Regain their level in HP
- Regain all spent Spell Slots
- Regain all spent Effort
- Lose 1 point of System Strain

### System Strain (Strain)
Max System Strain = Con Score.

- Strain is often caused by certain spells, poisons, privation, or healing. A target @ max Strain cannot benefit from anything that would increase their Strain above their max. Being forced above Max System Strain is lethal.
- A decent night's rest typically removes 1 point of Strain.

### Instant Death
Being reduced to ≤ 0HP by a heavy attack (boulders, cannonfire) = instant death.

### Poisons & Disease
Phys Save to avoid. Possible Effects: HP Loss, Hallucination, Increased Strain, Death, Debuff… Lingering maladies may require multiple Saves over time to remove. Failure = worsening effects or death.

### Falling
1d6 damage per 10' of fall. ½ if done in a controlled manner w/ a successful Exert Check (DC 7 + 1 per every 10').

### Suffocation
PCs act normally w/o air for 1 round x Con Score. NPCs last 10 Rounds. After, they lose 1HP x level per Round.
