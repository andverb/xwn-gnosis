## Sea Travel

### Travel & Provisions
- Ships can sail 24hrs/day if far from coasts & other peril. Ships move ½ speed in unfavorable weather & stall w/0 wind.
- **Provisions:** Food(250 person-days) 500$p, 1t. Water(50 person-days) 0$p, 1t. Repair Supplies (15HP) 200$p, 1t.
- Calamity or privation may force a crew morale check. Failures can eventually result in mutiny if not quelled.

### Crew
**Cost by month / Crew Strength:**
- Sailor: 50$p / 1
- Officer: 250$p / x2 (reqs 10 troops)
- Captain: 250$p / x5 (reqs 100 troops)

**Crew considerations:**
- Expeditions w/o prospects of riches might find crew @ x5 to x10 the usual pay rate, but few sailors will risk their lives for less.
- Crews of ships commissioned for privateering, piracy, or expeditions into the unknown typically demand shares of the profit.
- Ship's owner: ½ of profit & magic items. The 2nd ½ split in shares: Capt = 5, officer = 2, & sailor = 1. (Pirates split haul evenly).
- Common sailors don't require extra incentive for ordinary peril (minor sea monsters, magical storms, pirate assault…).

### Ships & Expenses
- Every 3 months ships require 1 week in port for maintenance & repairs (5% of ship, weapons, etc… total cost).
- Repair costs: Missing HP x 5$p. Best Craft Skill + best Sail Skill = Max HP restorable per day.
- Ship upgrades cost a % of the ship's total cost & increase a ship's stat by the same percentage (typically between 5% to 20%).

### Combat at Sea
- Such brawls can be run as normal combat encounters w/ a few exceptions (see below) or as mass combats (see pg 15).
- Ships receive their own Turn in combat in which they can fire off 1 of their weapons provided they have the crew to do so. Once a ship's weapon is fired, it's assumed the weapon's crew begins reloading unless they're unable to do so or take up another task.
- A ship also has a movement action they may use to try to gain an advantage vs their foe, gaining a bonus to their attack, dam, or AC.
