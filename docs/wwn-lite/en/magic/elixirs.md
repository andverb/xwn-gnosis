## Elixirs

### Elixir Basics
- Elixirs must be consumed as part of their activation, typically requiring a Main Action for a readied Elixir.
- An Elixir = 1Є when Readied. A GM may allow some to be packed together @ 0 Є but they'll be inaccessible in combat.
- Salves & unguents can't be applied to a hostile or resisting target.
- Identifying Elixirs requires a detection spell, legible label, tasting a drop to guess, or 1 day & a Wis or Int Magic check vs its creation DC. Only 1 chance. If elixir was tainted or fouled it may detect incorrectly.
- Elixirs aren't uncommon in dungeons. Purchasing them requires a relationship w/ a skilled brewer & a reason for them to brew.

### Elixir List

**Anchoring Draught**: Range: 10mi. Lasts 24hrs. Main Action: Imbiber teleports back to the spot they drank the potion, along w/ any objects & willing or incapacitated creatures they are carrying.

**Bestial Form**: Lasts Death or dawn. Imbiber changes into an animal they choose (≤ a horse, ≥ a rat). They gain the creature's means of movement & speed, but retain their stats. Belongings meld w/ them & maintain their benefits. On Turn Action to end.

**Blood of Boiling Rage**: Lasts 1 Scene. Roll attacks & damage w/ Adv. Every Round imbiber must attack or move to attack. Main Action & Mental Save to end. On failure: spend the next Round raging before trying again. Can't cast spells while raging.

**Bodily Innervation**: Rare. Once every 3 days it can decrease current Strain by -3.

**Borrowed Flesh**: A creature may transfer ≤ 6HP into the elixir by willingly adding their own blood & accepting an = amount of damage. This fleshy slurry lasts 1 month, during which the brew can be poured on a wounded subject to restore as much HP as was charged into it. The flesh mending the wound is the same as the donor, but will assimilate w/in months.

**Cold Courage**: The user of this potion is filled w/ invincible confidence for 1 scene. They attack w/ a Skill check instead of an attack roll @ DC = ½ the foe's AC↓. They are immune to mental effects that alter emotions. While under this influence, however, the GM tracks their HP & damage taken. The player is told only when they hit 0HP.

**Congealed Winter**: When opened or shattered, every water-based liquid w/in 20' instantly flash-freezes ≥ 1' deep, fires in range are extinguished, & living creatures take 2d6 damage. Vs liquid or fiery creatures the damage is max.

**Energetic Impermeability**: Grants immunity to the next harmful energy that would injure the imbiber w/in 1 scene. Protects from mundane sources of the energy & subtracts 15 damage from each hit by a magical source of that power. Energy forms include thermal, electrical, radiation, or caustic. Kinetic, psychic, & spiritual forms still harm. Does not change once set by the initial harm deflected.

**Murderous Anointing**: When applied to a weapon it gains a brief semi-sentience bent on bloodshed. For 1 scene, the wielder can accept +1 Strain to reroll a failed attack roll w/ the weapon, 1/failed attack. The treated weapon can't be used for nonlethal strikes.

**Nectar of Immortality**: Each bottle consumed adds an additional 1d6 years to the subject's healthy lifespan & cures all but the most sorcerously-potent afflictions. The nectar can't do > x2 the subject's natural lifespan, & after each dose there is a 1-in-20 chance the subject perishes in a hideous welter of cancers & growths.

**Nepenthe**: 1/lifetime this liquid can relieve a subject from mental trauma & cure madness. Insanity wrought by magic requires a Mental Save. On failure the draught can't break the curse.

**Omened Visions**: Pale blue powder that allows the user to explore the immediate future. Their next 15 min will play out in their visions, their actions chosen as they wish & their most probable consequences made evident in the dreamlike fugue, assuming those consequences are evident w/in the next 15 min. While under this effect the subject is oblivious to the mundane world.

**Persistent Luminescence**: When applied or imbibed the target glows 30' (persists 1 week or until dispelled).

**Plasmic Molding**: When applied to a mundane object smaller than a large door it becomes malleable as clay for 1 scene. At the end of the scene, the material hardens back to its original consistency in whatever form it now takes. If taken by a living creature, they may reshape their own body to a degree, taking any appearance that a creature of their species might naturally have. This alteration lasts until dispelled or the user ends it, but they can't recover Strain while so altered.

**Quintessence of the Hour**: When imbibed, the user is whisked back to a perfect temporal parallel of time from their past, occupying the body they had for 1hr. They may do as they wish in that time & place, but if they die in that hour, they die in the present as well. At the hour's end their mind is returned to the present. Nothing that happened in the facsimile has any effect on true reality, but things they learned or observed during that hour may be retained.

**Sacrificial Strength**: When imbibed, the user is capable of channeling their own life force into the damage they do. One time w/in the next scene, as an Instant Action, they may sacrifice a # of HP of their choice when they damage a target. Every 4HP = +1d6 (5d6 max). The user must retain ≥ 1HP & the bonus damage can be applied to only 1 target of a damaging Action.

**Sanctified Healing**: When applied to a target, it heals 1d6+1 HP instantly.

**Scalding Breath**: The imbiber of this fluid can exhale it again as a Main Action to do 4d6 + level damage to all targets w/in a cone 30' long & wide. Victims make an Evasion Save for ½ damage. Different fluids produce different noxious exhalations. Flame, frost, poison, & radiation are not uncommon. Only 1 breath attack is allowed, & if not made w/in a scene the potion is wasted.

**Soul Sight**: If applied to a creature's eyes this salve inhibits tasks like reading, but not fighting, & allows the creature to see living entities as glowing colored outlines regardless of light or invisibility. They can identify individuals by their glow, & the glow reveals the subject's current mental state as described in 1 or 2 words. Lasts for 6 hrs or until rinsed from their eyes.

**Truthspeaking**: When applied to, the user must envision a specific query before anointing a restrained, willing, or helpless sentient target w/ the potion. The subject makes a Mental Save to resist. Failure = they tell the user a truthful, undeceptive answer to the question in < 5 sentences. Success = the elixir is tainted & instead the target will instead give the answer the user thinks is most plausible. The user can't discern the result of the target's save, except by their own good judgment of the answer.

**Wrathful Detonation**: These flasks are permanently sealed & when hurled w/ intention never miss. They detonate for 2d6 damage to all targets w/in 15', w/ a range of 60'. They will not explode by accident, & only 1 flask can be hurled at a time.
