## Magical Workings

### Basics

- A Working is a stationary, persistent magic that persists until destroyed or decayed.
- Workings require a 6th level Mage or Partial Mage caster who can cast spells. 
- If the designer's Level x Magic Skill x 2 ≥ the Working's DC, they can establish it alone. If ≥ ½ DC, they will need to find other mages to make up the difference. If < ½ the DC, the Working is too difficult.
- Player discusses the goal, & the GM sets the DC of effect. Total DC of the Working = most costly element + 1/2 the rest ↑.
- Time cost = 1 month + 1 week per 5 points of DC or fraction thereof.
- Monetary cost = 1000 $p х DC
- x2 cost = ½ time (only applies to the magical components of the Working. Mundane structures must be built prior).
