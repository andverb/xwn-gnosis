### Druids & Beasts

Many Druid arts & spells refer to "beasts" as being valid targets. For the purposes of these abilities, a "beast" is any animal, magical beast, or monstrous plant creature that has < human intelligence. Druids can target any such creatures, but if they have more hit dice or levels than the Druid, they gain a +4 bonus on any saves a power may grant.

### Arts of the Druid

### Druid Spells

**DELUDE BEAST LEVEL 1**: Targets up to 1d6 beasts + 1 per caster level. Range: 100'. Duration: While the caster is present & 1 hour after departed. Beasts already in combat or in fear for their lives are unaffected. Mental Save. Failure = their senses are under the control of the caster, who can make them see, smell, or hear what they wish. If a delusion would put them in physical danger the spell breaks. The caster cannot change the illusions once they've left the target's presence.

**ENTHRALL BEAST LEVEL 1**: Requires a visible beast w/in 100'. Mental Save. Failure = the beast becomes docile & obedient to the caster (obeys verbal orders w/ a human intellect so long as they are neither suicidal nor contrary to its nature). The beast will fight for the caster, provided the odds are not overwhelming. The caster can have a # of enthralled beasts = to their level or a total hit dice of beasts ≤ 2x the caster's level, whichever is fewer.

**SEASONAL GROWTH LEVEL 1**: Requires 1 hr to cast while the mage paces the boundaries of the area to be affected, ≤ 1 acre x caster level. Once cast, the plant life w/in the area gains ≤ 1 yr of growth. This gain is uniform & indiscriminate. One acre of a peasant crop will yield enough to feed 2 people for 1 year, or 3 if the field is carefully prepared beforehand. This spell can't be cast again w/in a 1 mi radius until next spring.

**SHAPE PLANTS LEVEL 1**: Bend & shape or destroy all living, non magical plant material w/in 1 contiguous 10' cube x caster level. Requires 5 min to shape, but destruction of matter is instant. If used against plant-based monsters, the spell does 1d10 damage x caster level (Physical Save for ½). Cutting through magically shaped barriers takes 5hp x caster level of damage to cut a man-sized hole, & requires weapons suitable for chopping wood. The plants can be shaped w/ enough precision to make crude tools that have no moving parts.

**WOOD WARD LEVEL1**: Requires 1 visible subject w/in 30' x caster level. Lasts 1 scene. Target becomes immune to non-magical wooden or wood-hafted weapons or implements, as well as plant-derived toxins, spores, or glues. This spell can cure poisonings or infestations.

**BEAST PELLET LEVEL 2**: Requires a dead, mostly-intact beast ≤ an ox & 1 week. Magical spores cover the corpse, causing it to shrink to a marble sized pellet. The caster may hurl the pellet w/in 30' as a Main Action, whereupon the beast will reappear fully intact, albeit undead. It obeys the caster's spoken commands w/ human intellect & suicidal devotion. The beast withers away to dust 1 hr after summoning. The caster may have no more pellets at once than their level, & each pellet they carry subtracts 1 point from their maximum System Strain.

**BEAST SHAPE LEVEL 2**: The caster may adopt the outward semblance of any normal beast or plant < an ox & > a mouse. They gain the movement rating of the beast & its ability to breathe water or endure natural temperature extremes, but the caster's other statistics, senses, or unarmed attacks are unchanged. Any worn or held equipment merges w/ the beast form & continues to confer its usual AC or weapon statistics; the caster cannot change gear or drop items until the spell ends. Lasts until dispelled, next dawn, or ended as an On Turn action.

**SICKLES OF BONE LEVEL 2**: Requires ≤ 1 willing target x caster level. Range 30'. Targets grow long, sharp claws of bone for 1 hr x caster level. Targets are capable of clawing 2 in/min through plant matter. These claws do not hinder the user's dexterity, but count as magical weapons (1d8 damage, Shock 2/15, attribute = Str or Dex). If the caster is the target, they may use Magic instead of Stab or Punch as the combat skill. If cast on a creature that already has claws, fangs, or other natural weapons (not including unarmed-trained humans) the creature gains a bonus to damage rolls & Shock equal to the caster's level.

**TRACE THE PATH LEVEL 2**: The caster must focus on the image of a person or a type of creature when casting this spell. The plant life around the mage immediately telepathically directs the caster in the direction of whatever creature last fit the description, provided the tracked target would be perceptible to human senses. The plant life continues to lead the caster for up to 1hr x level, though the spell ends at dusk or when the caster casts another spell.

**BEAST WARD LEVEL 3**: Caster must pace off an area ≤ 1 acre x level, or spend a Main Action indicating a straight line ≤ 40' long w/in 100'. Wild beasts will not cross into the warded area or pass the indicated line unless permitted by the caster. Creatures who somehow end up in the area will think of nothing but fleeing it. Area wards persist as long as the caster remains inside them. Line wards or abandoned areas cease to protect 1 hr x level afterwards. Beasts incapable of feeling fear are unaffected by this spell.

**FERAL BARGAIN LEVEL 3**: This spell does not function in combat, & must be cast on a beast w/in 50' of the caster. The spell immediately opens a telepathic link w/ the target, after which the caster must offer something that the beast would reasonably want in exchange for a service from the beast. Even a hostile creature will spend a few mins parlaying unless directly threatened, & will negotiate w/ a human level of intelligence. If the mage can offer a suitable price for the creature's cooperation, the bargain will be made & the creature will be bound to perform it w/ human intelligence if they are capable of doing it & it is not suicidally dangerous. If the caster fails to keep their end of the bargain under the same terms, however, they must make a Mental save to avoid immediate death from the psychic backlash.

**PLANT WALK LEVEL 3**: Requires a willing target w/in 30' touching a plant of a volume ≥ their body. Once cast, the spell's recipient disappears into the plant. As a Main Action, they can step out of any plant of similar or larger size w/in 100' x caster level. Optionally, they can instead cast their senses to such a target plant & observe their surroundings as if standing there. Lasts 15 min or ends when the subject steps out of a plant. Damage inflicted on a plant while the subject is hiding in it is done to them as well.

**FORCE BEAST SHAPE LEVEL 4**: Functions as Beast Shape but can target even an unwilling creature w/in 100' (Physical save negates). If the creature is of a level > the caster, it rolls its Save w/ Advantage. The shifted creature retains its own stats, but drops its possessions when it changes. Lasts until dispelled or ended. Each week spent as an animal they must succeed a Mental save or succumb to the beast's nature & forget their prior life forever, gaining the attributes of the natural animal. If killed in animal shape they remain an animal in death.

**HARMONIOUS PASSAGE LEVEL 4**: Affects the caster & up to 3 other visible allies x caster level. So long as the spell is maintained, those protected are immune to plant or animal derived toxins or spores & are considered inedible by beasts, who will ignore them unless greatly provoked. They leave no mundanely-perceptible trace of their passage over unpaved earth & are immune to inclement weather, provided the atmosphere is not outright unsurvivable. Lasts until dawn, or until a subject voluntarily harms a beast or large plant.

**CLAIM DOMAIN LEVEL 5**: Requires 5 hrs & a full moon. Once cast, all the land w/in 1 mi x caster level is accounted part of the caster's domain. W/in this space, beasts will obey them w/ human intelligence in any way not contrary to their nature. The caster may speak w/ animals & plants w/in this area as if they had human intellect. They will also become intuitively aware of the location of any groups > 24 people traveling or living together. This domain cannot overlap w/ a prior caster's domain, & it has no power w/in the walls or boundary markers of human settlements or cities. A caster may maintain only 1 domain at a time.

**REND STRUCTURE LEVEL 5**: Range 200'. Affects only non magical structures. Plantlife erupts from the surface of the structure, their roots ripping it apart w/in 6 secs. The spell can affect only 1 structure or wall segment at a time & destroy no more than a 100' cube of it. The caster has very fine control of the demolition & can destroy only selective smaller parts of a structure, or prevent the demolition from harming those in or around the building. If not so careful, anyone w/in the structure takes 10d6 damage (Evasion save for ½).
