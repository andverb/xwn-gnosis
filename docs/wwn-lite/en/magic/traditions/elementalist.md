**BECKONED DELUGE**: Effort: Scene. Conjured water persists indefinitely. Range: 50' x Caster level. AoE: Sufficient to drench 10³ of matter x Caster level. Requires a visible point. Main Action.

**FLAMESIGHT**: Effort: Indefinite. On Turn Action. While Commited you gain thermal vision sufficient to see living creatures, even in darkness. Optionally, you may cast light from your eyes sufficient to illuminate your surroundings clearly. Range 30'.

**PAVIS OF ELEMENTS**: Effort: Indefinite. On Turn Action. While Commited you conjure an elemental barrier around yourself, increasing your AC by +4. This bonus stacks w/ other effects, but can't increase AC above 18.

**PETRIFYING STARE**: Effort: Day. Lasts Rounds = ½ Caster level ↑. Main Action. Requires a visible target. The creature makes a Phys Save or begins petrifying, losing its Move Action. Flying creatures are forced to land & swimming creatures will sink.

A handprint-size glowing rune forms on the surface, & any creature coming w/in 2' triggers an explosion of elemental force. Damage = 2d6 + Caster level.

### Elementalist Spells

**AQUEOUS HARMONY LEVEL 1**: Lasts 1hr x Caster level, or so long as a subject is still largely submerged, or until dispelled. Caster & ≤ 12 allies gain water-breathing, the ability to survive the depths, & can see clearly through water. Targets may move through water @ their usual move rate, their attacks & projectile weapons are not hindered by water, & their possessions remain dry & undamaged.

**FLAME SCRYING LEVEL 1**: Lasts while the caster remains motionlessly focused on the spell. Range: 30' x Caster level. The caster becomes aware of the approximate locations of all open flames w/in range. They can choose 1 of those flames as a focus for the scrying, allowing them to see & hear all around the flame as if present. The caster may switch their focus between various flames in range as they wish.

**SHAPE ELEMENT LEVEL 1**: Lasts 1 scene (permanently if the new shape is stable w/out the aid of magic). The caster makes a direct appeal to a mundane mass of earth, stone, water, flame, or air no larger than a 10' cube. At the end of the Round, the mass will move or reshape itself w/in that space as the caster requests.

**ELEMENTAL SPY LEVEL 1**: Lasts 1 day x Caster level, or until the charmed object is destroyed, dispersed, or consumed. The caster enchants a stone, 1 oz of liquid, a flame ≤ a candle… As a Main Action the caster can see & hear as if present by the object.

**FLY LEVEL 2**: Lasts ≤ 4th level casters = 1 scene, 5th-7th level = 1 hr, ≥ 8th level = until next dawn or dusk; or dispelled. Requires a visible ally w/in 100'. The target gains flight (x2 usual movement rate). If the spell ends while aloft the target floats gently to earth.

**FORM TUNNEL LEVEL 2**: AoE: ≤ 20' long (or 2' for worked stone) x Caster level, & ≤ 10' wide & tall. Caster carves a tunnel through natural stone or earth. The caster can choose to make the tunnel stable & sound or allow it to collapse naturally. Magical stone or earth can't be altered by this spell. The caster has basic control over the direction & interior features of the tunnel, & can form simple structures w/in it.

**CONTINUAL FLAME LEVEL 2**: Lasts Until dispelled, extinguished, or dropped. A flame no larger than the caster is made effectively eternal. It consumes no fuel, though it may be used to burn or heat other things, & it resists extinguishing save being buried or wholly immersed in water. The caster can temporarily extinguish it @ will. A # of such flames can be created = to the Caster level; beyond that, special ingredients & fuels are needed that cost 500 silver pieces per flame. If used as a weapon, it adds +2 damage to a successful hit (nothing to Shock).

**PACT OF ELEMENTAL RESISTANCE LEVEL 2**: Lasts 1 scene. Requires a visible target. The target is immune to injury caused by mundane manifestations of earth, water, fire, or wind (as chosen by the caster). Stone weapons don't harm them, water doesn't drown them, fire doesn't burn them, & wind doesn't topple them. This affects secondary effects of the material as well; a fire-pacted mage couldn't be boiled in a pot, & an earth-pacted one won't be suffocated if buried alive.

**ELEMENTAL WALL LEVEL 3**: Lasts 1 scene. Range: 200' from caster. AoE: 10' long x Caster level, w/ a height of 10' & a thickness of 1 ft. Calls forth a wall of a chosen elemental force which must rest on solid ground & may be shaped as desired. Earthen walls are impervious to anything but mining tools or rock-shattering strength, taking 20 HP of damage to knock a man-sized hole in them. Fire walls inflict 3d6 damage + the Caster level to any who pass through. Water walls spin & hurl creatures ≤ ox-size who pass through them, ejecting them @ a random point on the far side of the wall & doing 2d6 damage. Air walls are invisible, inaudible, & 20' in height; those who cross them suffer 1d6 + the Caster level in electrical damage.

**BECOME ELEMENT LEVEL 3**: Lasts 1 scene. The caster charges their physical shape w/ the qualities of a chosen element.

- **Stone**: automatically stabilize @ 0HP & ignore the 1st 3 points of damage from any source.
- **Water**: may pass through gaps a mouse could.
- **Air**: fly @ your move rate & gain a +4 AC vs ranged attacks.
- **Fire**: inflict 1d6 damage to all creatures in melee range @ the start of their turn each Round & gain immunity to heat damage.

In all cases, they need not breathe & gain immunity to poisons & diseases not already w/in them.

**GASEOUS FORM LEVEL 3**: Lasts 1 scene or target or caster ends. Requires a visible target. The creature & their possessions are briefly transformed into a misty cloud, only vulnerable to sources that could harm a cloud. They may pass freely into any area that a vapor could & move freely in 3 dimensions @ their movement rate. Can't physically handle objects.

**CALCIFY LEVEL 4**: Lasts Until dispelled or caster ends. Range 100'. Requires a visible target. Target must make a Phys Save or be turned to stone. Affects any size of living creature. Objects > a cart are unaffected. Objects being held or worn by someone else get a Phys Save made by their user. If the target is damaged while petrified, it may be harmed or killed upon its restoration. If the target's Save was successful, it is slowed & loses its Move Action for the 1d6 Rounds.

**ELEMENTAL GUARDIAN LEVEL 4**: Lasts until destroyed or the next dawn. The caster imbues a human-sized mass of earth, water, fire, or air w/ a crude awareness & an eagerness to defend them. Guardian Stats: HD 4, AC 15, MV 40', Skill +1, SV 13+, Instinct 0, Morale 12, melee attack of +6/1d10, no Shock. **Earth**: HD 6. **Fire**: 5/- Shock damage. **Water**: AC 18. **Air**: Flies @ its rate of movement. Has human intelligence; can communicate w/ others & handle objects. Serves w/ suicidal devotion. Limit of 1 elemental summoned @ a time & if destroyed a new elemental can't be summoned in the same scene.

**FURY OF THE ELEMENTS LEVEL 5**: Range: 200' x Caster level. AoE 30' of target point. Molten rock, searing wind, & steam erupt to ravage a target point causing 10d6 damage. Convention structures are destroyed. The target point moves 1d6x10' in a random direction @ the start of the next Round, blasting everything in its path. The point wanders for 1d6 Rounds before ending. Molten remnants persist after the spell ends, a hazard for any who enter the area for the rest of the day.

**EARTHQUAKE LEVEL 5**: Requires a visible point & 5 min for effects to fully manifest. AoE: radius ≤ 500'. Caster calls a deep tremor which can destroy any structures, tunnels, or caves w/in the AoE unless such structures are magically reinforced. The effects are negated if dispelled w/in 1 min of its casting; after that it's too late to stop.
