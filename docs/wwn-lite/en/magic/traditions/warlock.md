## Arcane Tradition of the Warlock (Half Class)

- The Warlock exists only as a partial Mage class to be taken alongside a partial Warrior or partial Expert.
- Warlocks gain Magic as a bonus Skill, acquiring it at level-0, or level+1 if they already have it at level-0.
- A Warlock begins play knowing either the Art "Accursed Blade" or "Accursed Bolt," & 1 more of their choosing.
- Warlocks can't cast spells, but gain x2 as many Arts as is typical for a Partial Mage, earning 2 Arts at levels 3, 6, & 9.
- Warlock Arts are not hindered by the wearing of armor.
- Foci that normally apply to mundane weapons such as Armsmaster or Deadeye also benefit their relevant melee or ranged attacks. For these Foci, read "Magic" in place of "Shoot" or "Stab" when gaining their benefits, including the granted Skill & the stacking damage bonus that the 1st level of the Focus may grant.
