## Arcane Tradition of the Beastmaster (Half Class)

- The Beastmaster exists only as a partial Mage class to be taken alongside a partial Warrior or partial Expert.
- Beastmasters gain Survive as a bonus Skill, acquiring it at level-0, or level+1 if they already have it at level-0.
- A Beastmaster begins play knowing the Art "Bind Companion," & 1 more of their choosing.
- Beastmasters can't cast spells, but gain x2 as many Arts as is typical for a Partial Mage, earning 2 Arts at levels 3, 6, & 9.
- Beastmaster Arts are not hindered by the wearing of armor.

### Rules Concerning Animal Companions

- A Beastmaster is limited to 1 companion animal at a time. An animal can be left in any terrain suitable for its survival. Unless killed before the Beastmaster's return, the creature can be expected to be found in the same vicinity later. Released creatures are usually friendly to the Beastmaster still, unless mistreated or exceptionally savage.
- A companion animal functions as an independent allied creature. It will obey commands from the Beastmaster that aren't contrary to its nature or beyond its intellect, & will fight, move, check Instinct & Morale, & act independently in combat.
- If the creature is mistreated or used as cannon fodder, it can flee or turn on its former master.
- A companion animal can't have a number of HD > the Beastmaster's level +1.
- A companion animal can't have human levels of intelligence.
- A companion animal must be given a name by the Beastmaster.

### Arts of the Beastmaster

Beastmaster Effort is calculated w/ Survive. Max Effort = Survive + Wis or Cha modifier (min of 1).

Scene: Returned after 1 Scene. Indefinite: Returned once Art is instantly "turned off." Day: Returned after 1 Night's Rest.

**BIND COMPANION**: Main Action. W/ a day's work in a location, you can find & bind a suitable animal companion. If looking for a specific type of companion, it must be found in the area & may require a Wis/Survive Skill check at a DC ≥ 10 or more for a particularly rare creature. The creature is allowed a Mental Save to resist binding & become impervious to your powers. You may release a companion as a Main Action if you no longer wish its service or want to bind a different beast.

**BEAST WARD**: Effort: Indefinite. On Turn Action. While Committed the Beastmaster will not be attacked by unintelligent beasts unless the beast is commanded to do so by a master, the beast is starving, or the Beastmaster or their allies performs some hostile act against it. Once the ward ends or is broken, it can't be re-established in the same scene. Magical beasts & those trained specifically as guardians get a Mental Save to resist this power.

**EYES OF THE BEAST**: Effort: Scene. On Turn Action. Lasts 1 Scene. You can share the senses of your companion. Neither of you can be surprised unless both are surprised.

**FERAL TOUGHNESS**: Your max HP total is increased by the natural, unmodified HD of your companion(a 5HD companion increases your max HP by 5). You are impervious to normal outdoor extremes of heat or cold. Your base AC = 14 + ½ your level ↑. This AC can be modified by shields or Dex modifiers, but not by armor.

**HOWL OF DISTANT SUMMONS**: Effort: Day. Main Action. Extend a howl through time & space. The subject will have received the message in time to reach your side w/in 5 min. Once summoned, you may bind it again if you have no current companion. If the journey is exceptionally dangerous, difficult, or long, you'll need to make a Cha/Survive Skill check against a DC ≥ 10. On failure the beast could not make the journey & can't be called by this power for 1 wk.

**KNOW THE WEAK SPOT**: When inflicting damage on a beast w/ a weapon or physical attack, roll the damage x2 & take the higher. Optionally; Effort: Scene. Instant Action. When an ally w/in earshot hits a beast; your shouted assistance allows them to roll damage twice & take the better result as well.

**MIND CALL**: Effort: Scene. On Turn Action. Lasts 1 Scene. You forge a telepathic bond w/ your animal companion. You can give it orders & receive information from the creature, at least insofar as its limited intellect allows.

**NATURAL WEAPONRY**: Your unarmed attacks count as weapons. Attribute: Str or Dex, Skill: Punch or Stab, damage: 1d8, Shock: 2/AC 13. They can harm creatures immune to mundane weapons. Damage & Shock increase +1 @ level 3, +2 @ level 6, & +3 @ level 9.

**SAVAGE SENSES**: Effort: Scene. On Turn Action. Lasts 1 Scene. You are capable of seeing clearly even in pitch blackness, can scent out trails & belongings as perfectly as a wolf could, & gain a +2 on all Notice checks involving sight, sound, or smell.

**SHARED VITALITY**: Your bound animal companions have HD ≥ your level, even if normally fewer. Its hit bonus can't be < 1/2 its hit dice ↑. A Beastmaster can stabilize an Mortally Wounded companion by Committing Effort for the scene as an Instant Action.

**SWIFT HEALING**: Effort: Day. Main Action to heal 1d6 damage x character level to a wounded companion. This healing can be extended only 1/scene or 15 min.

**TONGUE OF THE BEASTS**: Effort: Indefinite. On Turn Action. While Commited you can speak w/ animals as if possessing human intellect, though their interests, knowledge, & desires do not change.
