- The Monk exists only as a partial Mage class to be taken alongside a partial Warrior or partial Expert.
- All Monks gain a non-combat bonus skill appropriate to their order, acquiring it at level-0, or level-1 if they already have it at level-0.
- A Monk begins play knowing Martial Style, Unarmed Might, Unarmored Defense, & 1 additional Art of their choosing.
- Monks can't cast spells, but gain x2 as many Arts as is typical for a Partial Mage, earning 2 Arts at levels 3, 6, & 9.
- Monk Arts cannot be used while wearing armor or using shields.

### Arts of the Monk

Monk Effort is calculated w/ their chosen non-combat skill. Max Effort = Chosen skill + best Attribute modifier (min of 1).

Scene: Returned after 1 Scene. Indefinite: Returned once Art is instantly "turned off." Day: Returned after 1 Night's Rest.

**MARTIAL STYLE**: At third level, any attack using the Punch skill counts as a magic weapon.

**UNARMED MIGHT**: Your unarmed attack damage increases as you gain levels. You may add your Punch skill to the damage done by these attacks as usual, but Foci such as Unarmed Combatant that improve your usual Punch damage do not apply to you.

- Punch Shock begins at 1/15 @ level 1, increases to 2/15 @ level 2, 3/15 @ level 6, & 4/15 @ level 9.
- Punch damage begins at 1d6 @ level 1, increases to 1d8 @ level 3, 1d10 @ level 5, 1d10+1 @ level 7, 1d10+2 @ level 9, & 1d10+3 @ level 10.

**UNARMORED DEFENSE**: When not wearing armor or using a shield, your base Armor Class is equal to 13 + ½ your level ↓.

**BRUTAL COUNTER**: Effort: Scene. Instant action. After resolving an enemy melee attack against you, whether it hits or misses, you may make a free physical attack against your assailant, using either a normal attack or some other offensive ability that takes no more than 1 Main Action to execute. You cannot use this art > once per round vs a single foe, but you may use it while performing a Total Defense.

**FAULTLESS AWARENESS**: Your awareness is such that you cannot be surprised, & will even wake from a sound sleep in time to respond normally to some imminent peril.

**HURLING THROW**: After you make a successful attack, you may Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action. The target must make a Physical Save or be thrown up to 10' in any direction, falling prone on landing & suffering the damage rolled for your attack. If the Physical save is successful, the target simply takes damage as normal. This art can be used only once per round on any given target, & the target must be no larger than an ox.

**THE INWARD EYE**: Effort: Indefinite. On Turn action. For as long as it remains Committed, you are mystically aware of your surroundings w/ a sense equivalent to normal eyesight regardless of darkness, obscuring mists, or your eyes being closed or blinded.

**LEAP OF THE HEAVENS**: Effort: Scene. Use a Move action to leap up to your full Move action horizontally or half that vertically. You may also Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action to negate falling damage, no matter the distance.

**MASTER'S VIGOR**: Your body retains its vigor & youthful vitality to the full normal span of your life. You regain 2 lost hp per hour due to your natural restorative powers.

**MOB JUSTICE**: Effort: Day. Instant action. Become impervious to the Make a Swarm Attack maneuver. Your assailants cannot use this maneuver against you for the rest of the scene, & you become immune to Shock as long as you remain in melee w/ ≥ 2 foes. Making use of this benefit disrupts any spellcasting you may attempt, however, due to the violent motion required.

**NIMBLE ASCENT**: Effort: Scene. On Turn action. For the remainder of the scene you may move up vertical & overhanging surfaces & across difficult terrain at your full movement rate w/ no chance of slipping or falling, provided the surface is not glass-smooth or enchanted. You require only one free hand to cling to a wall or ceiling.

**PURIFIED BODY**: Effort: Day. Instant action. Use to cure any disease or poison currently affecting you, or instead to negate any need for sleep, food, water, or air for the next 24 hours.

**REVIVIFYING BREATH**: Effort: Day. On Turn action. Limit: 1/scene. Heal yourself for 1d6 hp + your level. This healing does not increase Strain. This ability may be used on your turn even when you are at 0 hp, but in such a case it Commits all your remaining Effort for the day.

**SHATTERING STRIKE**: Effort: Day. Requires 1 full round of motionlessness to prepare. On the next round, as a Main Action, your unarmed attack can shatter a wooden door, wooden wall, or other similar object up to a depth of 1' x level & a width sufficient to allow a man-sized creature to pass through. At 4th level this ability improves to affect even a stone wall & at 7th it can affect even a metal wall or solid iron door. The blow is useless against a target that can move, but against an immobilized creature the attack does 1d12 damage x level.

**STYLE WEAPONRY**: Pick 3 general classes of weapons (swords, bows, axes, daggers, etc). When using weapons of those classes, you may use Punch for hit rolls instead of Stab or Shoot. Your Punch skill does not add to the damage done by these weapons, however, though the benefits of Martial Style apply to their hit rolls.

**UNOBTRUSIVE STEP**: You not only possess a considerable skill for disguise & obfuscation, you can become extremely hard to detect. Once per scene, you may Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to reroll a failed Sneak skill check or skill check related to impersonating someone else.
