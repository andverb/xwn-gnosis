## Arcane Tradition of the Bard (Half Class)

- The Bard exists only as a partial Mage class to be taken alongside a partial Warrior or partial Expert. (HB)
- Bards gain Perform as a bonus Skill, acquiring it at level-0, or level+1 if they already have it at level-0.
- Bards begin play knowing the Art "A Thousand Tongues" & 1 more Art of their choosing.
- A Bard can't cast spells, but gains x2 as many Arts as is typical for a Partial Mage, earning 2 Arts at levels 3, 6, & 9.
- Bard Arts are not hindered by the wearing of armor.
- Bard Arts are unique in that they do not count as magical effects for the purposes of abilities that counter or detect magic.
- Bards are not restricted from taking foci or abilities that would typically be withheld from Mages/Partial Mages.
- Bards are unique in that they are allowed to craft Works & Mods as though they were Experts/Partial Experts.

### Arts of the Bard

Bard Effort is calculated w/ Perform. Max Effort = Perform + Cha modifiers (min of 1).

Scene: Returned after 1 Scene. Indefinite: Returned once Art is instantly "turned off." Day: Returned after 1 Night's Rest.

**A THOUSAND TONGUES**: Your arts that require communication are intuitively understood by all intelligent creatures, whether or not you speak their language. You can learn a new language w/ ≤ 1 week of study w/ a native speaker.

**BATTLE CRY**: Effort: Day. On Turn Action. Bolster your allies. They gain +1 to hit, saves, & damage, including Shock, for 1 Round x level. At 4th level, this bonus increases to +2, & at 9th, to +3.

**CURSED TUNE**: Effort: Scene. Main Action. While targeting an intelligent creature, you inflict a -1 penalty to their hit, damage, & Saves for 1 Round x level. At 4th level, this penalty becomes -2, & at 9th it becomes -3.

**DEFT FINGERS**: Your max Readied item count increases by 2.

**ENTANGLE INCANTATION**: Effort: Scene. Instant Action. Limit: 1/Round. Range 60'. Force a caster to make an opposed Int/Magic vs Cha/Perform Skill check vs you (+2 bonus to your roll). On tie or Failure, the spell fizzles & is wasted.

**EVOKE EMOTION**: Effort: Day. Main Action. Lasts 1 Scene. Limit: 1/Scene. Your performance evokes a desired emotion in listeners, whether intelligent or animal, granting a +1 to relevant social Skill checks for you & your allies. If desired, you can force a new ReAct Roll, taking it if it's more favorable than the original. This Art doesn't work in combat.

**INSPIRE DREAD**: Effort: Day. Instant Action. When your foes are forced to roll a Morale check, goad their fears & force them to make 2 Morale checks instead of 1. Those who succeed on both must still make an Instinct check immediately after.

**KEEN SENSES**: Your transcendent ear provides the equivalent of sight out to 60' even if blinded. You can't distinguish colors, but you can perceive physical details as readily as if w/ your eyes. Invisible creatures & objects are obvious to you.

**LIBERATING SONG**: Effort: Scene. Instant Action. You are immune to mind & emotion-controlling effects. Grant any ally w/in earshot of you a Mental Save to throw off such effects, assuming a Save was allowed to begin w/. If the 2nd Save is failed, this Art can't help them.

**RALLY**: Effort: Day. Main Action. The target regains 2d6 + your level HP & loses any Frailty. You gain +1 Strain.

**SOOTHE THE SAVAGE**: Effort: Day. Main Action. For as long as you keep spending a Main Action performing each Round, animals & other living bestial creatures will not attack you or your allies unless commanded by their masters or threatened by the party. This Art can't be triggered once actual combat has begun.

**SOOTHING GRACES**: You & your allies lose +1 Strain after a night's comfortable rest. Doesn't stack w/ similar rest abilities.

**SWIFT MISDIRECTION**: Effort: Scene. Main Action. Target 1 intelligent creature w/in earshot. Tell them something in ≤ 1 sentence. Unless what you say is impossible or emotionally unbearable, they must make a Mental Save or believe it for 1 Round. After that, they can judge your words w/ their normal reason. This Art can affect a creature only 1/Scene.
