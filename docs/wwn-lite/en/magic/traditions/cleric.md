## Arcane Tradition of the Cleric (Half Class)

- The Cleric exists only as a partial Mage class to be taken alongside a partial Warrior or partial Expert.
- Clerics gain Pray as a bonus Skill, acquiring it at level-0, or level+1 if they already have it at level-0.
- A Cleric begins play knowing 2 Arts of their choosing.
- Clerics can't cast spells, but gain x2 as many Arts as is typical for a Partial Mage, earning 2 Arts at levels 3, 6, & 9.
- Cleric Arts are not hindered by the wearing of armor.
- Cleric Arts require no gestures or free hand to use, though usually a prayer must be vocalized.

### Arts of the Cleric

Cleric Effort is calculated w/ Pray. Max Effort = Pray + Wis or Cha modifiers (min of 1).

Scene: Returned after 1 Scene. Indefinite: Returned once Art is instantly "turned off." Day: Returned after 1 Night's Rest.

**A THOUSAND TONGUES**: Effort: Indefinite. On Turn Action. While Committed you can speak w/ & understand any sentient creature w/ a language of their own. To a listener, it will seem as if you are perfectly fluent in their own language, even as you speak in your own native tongue. Does not allow you to read or write unknown languages.

**ARMOR OF GOD**: Effort: Indefinite. On Turn. While Committed you have a natural AC of 14 + 1/2 your level ↑. This AC can be modified by shields or your Dexterity modifier, but not by other worn armor.

**DIVINE GUIDANCE**: Effort: Day. Main Action. Meditate upon a choice before you. The GM will tell you whether the likely outcome is weal, woe, a mix, or insignificant, using their best estimation. This insight can't perceive likely outcomes > 1hr into the future.

**FEAR NO FLAME**: Effort: Day. On Turn Action. Lasts 1 scene. Requires a visible target. Target becomes immune to mundane flame, smoke, or explosive damage, & decreases magical damage of the sort by 5 x level of Pray the caster has.

**GOD WILLS IT**: Effort: Day. Instant Action. Lasts 1 scene. Loudly call down your God's blessing on your comrades. Up to 6 allies x Caster level w/in earshot gain a Morale of 12 & a +1 bonus to hit & damage rolls, including any Shock inflicted. At 5th level, this becomes a +2 bonus, & at 10th level, it becomes a +3 bonus.

**MERCIFUL HEALING**: Effort: Day. Main Action. Touch a target w/in melee range. The target receives 1d6+2 points of magical healing. If done in combat or used to revive an Mortally Wounded subject, the healing adds +1 Strain to the target. No Strain is added if applied outside of combat. At 4th level the healing increases to 2d6+4, & at 8th level it becomes 4d6+8.

**SANCTIFIED WARD**: Effort: Indefinite. On Turn Action. While Committed & until you take a hostile Act against a creature, you are immune to Shock damage & gain a +4 bonus to your AC & Saves. Foes must pass an Instinct check each Round to target you w/ attacks; on a failure, they may take some other Act instead. Once this art ends, it can't be reactivated for 1 scene. Healing & other indirect support of fighting comrades does not count as a hostile Action.

**SMITE THE WICKED**: Effort: Day. On Turn Action. Limit: 1/scene on a given target. Whenever you attack or take a damaging Act toward a single target, you gain +4 to any hit roll, you inflict your character level as automatic damage, & you roll any damage dice x2 & take the higher.

**THE LIGHT OF FAITH**: Effort: Indefinite. On Turn Action. While Committed you can cast a clear, bright radiance that extends up to 30' away from you. At will you may make this light visible to only you & ≤ 12 allies.

**TRANSUBSTANTIATION**: Effort: Day. Main Action. Transform ≤ 1 gal of liquid into sacred blood. A draught of this holy liquid can sustain the drinker for 1 day w/o further food or drink & heals 1d6 + the caster's Pray Skill. 1 gal of blood can aid ≤ 6 people. A creature can only benefit from sacred blood 1/day. Any undrunk blood sublimates away w/in 1 min.

**TURN FALSE LIFE**: Effort: Day. Main Action. Make the sign of your God before ≥ 1 visible targets w/in 60'. Roll 2d6 + Caster level; that many HD of undead, automatons, or other synthetic, extraplanar, or unnatural life forms must make Mental Saves or cower for 1 scene or until they or their allies are attacked. Cowering enemies take no hostile Act & flee unless bound to their location. This power does not affect foes w/ x2 as many HD as the Cleric has levels. If the rolled HD total isn't enough to fully affect a creature, it is unaffected.

**WORDS OF MERCY**: Effort: Day. Instant Action. Reroll a failed social Skill check related to maintaining peace, granting help, or encouraging virtuous acts of compassion, mercy, or truthfulness. Limited use of x1 on any given Skill check.

**WRATH OF THE MOST HIGH**: Effort: Scene. Main Action. Requires a visible target. The 1st time the target takes damage before the end of the next Round, it suffers automatic additional damage = to 1d8 + Caster level.
