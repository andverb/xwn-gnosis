### Arts of the Necromancers

Scene: Returned after 1 Scene. Indefinite: Returned once Art is instantly "turned off." Day: Returned after 1 Night's Rest.

**BONETALKER**: Effort: Scene. You can see & communicate w/ undead creatures regardless of language or invisibility. You can sense surface thoughts of visible undead. Unintelligent undead will not attack you or your allies unless compelled to by command or master. Intelligent undead will generally pause @ least for an initial parley before attacking.

**COLD FLESH**: Effort: None. You no longer require sleep & feel pain only in an abstract sense. You can suffer no more than 2 points of damage from any given instance of Shock & you have a natural AC = 12 + ½ your level ↓.

**CONSUME LIFE ENERGY**: Effort: None. On a successful Punch attack, or Stab attack using a melee weapon you've spent an hr consecrating, you can absorb a portion of the damage you inflict, healing 1d6 HP. The healing done can't be > the damage or target's remaining HP.

**FALSE DEATH**: Effort: Indefinite. Instant Action. While Commited you appear dead to mundane examination. You lose your Main Actions while "dead", but can move & perceive normally & do not need to eat, drink, breathe, or perform bodily functions. While "dead" poisons & diseases do not progress. You can maintain this state for ≤ 1 day x level before needing 1hr to recover.

**GRAVESIGHT**: Effort: Indefinite. On Turn Action. While Commited you can see the life energies of living creatures around you. You can perceive sicknesses, poisons, & other physical qualities on sight.

**KEEPER OF THE GATE**: Effort: None. Range: 20' x character level. At your discretion, Mortally Wounded creatures near you die instantly & can't be revived. Conversely: Effort: Day. You automatically stabilize any or all w/in range, increasing their System Strain by 1. This benefit can't aid creatures that have suffered unsurvivable injuries.

**LIFE BRIDGE**: Effort: Day. Lasts 1 Scene. Main Action. You can shift HP from a willing or helpless target no smaller than a dog to another, provided you are touching both. You can take enough HP to Mortally Wound a donor, but can't give more than the recipient's Max HP would allow.

**MASTER OF BONES**: Undead must roll x2 to save vs your abilities or spells & take the worse roll. Also, Effort: Scene. Instant Action. Negate 1 attack, magical power, or spell an undead uses against you. Undead >x2 your levels can't be foiled this way.

**RED HARVEST**: Effort: Day. Limit: 1/Round. Instant Action. When an intelligent living creature w/≥ 1 HD perishes w/in 50' of you, you may either heal 1d6 + your level HP, or gain a +4 bonus on your next hit roll this Scene. This art can't be stacked.

**UNAGING**: Effort: None. You no longer naturally age & remain hale & vigorous up to your species' natural max age + 20% x character level, after which you collapse into dust & decay. True immortality is possible, but requires consistent supplies of life energy, occult materials, or other difficult-to-acquire or morally questionable materials. You are immune to poison & disease.

**UNCANNY ICHOR**: Effort: None. Your blood is viscous & nauseating. Predators will avoid biting you & will not consider you edible. Piercing injuries can Mortally Wound you but can't result in your death unless you are entirely pincushioned or suffer catastrophic physical damage.

**UNLIVING PERSISTENCE**: Effort: Day. On Turn Action. Automatically stabilize when Mortally Wounded. You may use this ability to benefit others if able to touch them. This ability can't save a subject that has experienced an extremely final death.
