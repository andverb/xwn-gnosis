## Magic

### Arts & Effort
- Arts are fueled by Committing Effort. A PC's Class determines from whence Effort is based.
- Typically: Skill + Attribute Modifier + 1 (if Full Class) = Max Effort.
- **Committed Effort for the Scene** = Recharges after 1 Scene.
- **Committed Effort Indefinite** = Returned once you "turn off" an Art instantly.
- **Committed Effort for the Day** = Recharges after 1 Night's Rest.

### Preparing & Casting Spells
- A mage can prepare any spell from their spellbook after 1 night's rest. This takes approx 1hr.
- Spells typically require a Main Action, free hand, & vocalization as loud as conversation. Casting is obvious, but which spell isn't.
- Spells typically require line of sight w/ the target, unless line of sight would defeat the purpose of the spell (i.e. scrying, etc).
- Spells typically require a willing or helpless target, otherwise the target is allowed a Save to reduce or negate the effects.
- Spells typically last until dispelled by choice as an Instant action by the caster, or by force, such as the caster falling unconscious or dying, exceeding the spell's time limits, or exceeding its limitations (i.e. violent motion while invisible, etc).
- If a mage takes damage or is severely jostled they can't cast spells until their next turn. Damage does not interrupt Arts.
- Whether Spells or Arts can be cast while in armor will depend on the Class restrictions.
- The same spell may be cast > once if the mage has multiple castings left for the day.
- Partial Mages apply their full character level to any level-based effects from spells.

### Learning Spells
- Spellcasting full Mages begin w/ 4 1st level spells & Partial Mages w/ 2. Spells may be chosen from any spell list available to them.
- Some Mages gain new spells @ level up. High Mages pick 2 High Magic spells they are able to cast. Necromancers & Elementalists pick only 1, but can choose from High Magic spells or spells from their tradition. Partial Mages that are capable of casting spells learn spells just as full Mages do.
- Learning a spell from a grimoire = (1 week x Spell Level) - (1 week x Level of the Mage's Magic Skill). Min of 1 day.
- A PC must be capable of casting the spell to learn it.

### Grimoires
- Looted grimoires contain a # of spells to learn = to the level of its initial owner (assumed to be highest level spell's required casting level).
- To select spells, pick a 1st level spell, then continue picking spells successively until reaching the highest level spell the original owner could cast. Start over @ level 1 spells & continue like this until a # of spells have been chosen = to the original Mage's level.
- Some grimoires contain curses, & some spells contain flaws.

### Developing New Spells
- Int/Magic check = DC10 + Spell's Level. Magic-0 Apprentice: +1 bonus. Mage researching New Magic of their specialty: +1 bonus.
- On success the spell is created. On failure the initial time & money is lost & PCs must roll on the Formula Flaw table.
- PCs decide to quit or continue w/ the flawed spell, spending ½ the original time, no additional coin, & gaining a +1 bonus.
- PCs can repeat this process adding flaws & paying ½ the original time until successful or until they abandon the project.

**Spell design guidelines:**
- Spells should not substitute for other classes.
- Spells should not offer simple numeric bonuses.
- Spells should not offer cheap & easy combat damage.
- Spells that buff a target shouldn't last > a scene.
- Spells should not create permanent magical effects or valuable matter.
- Spells should not be petty.

### Spell Development Costs

| SPELL LEVEL | LAB FEE | MATERIAL FEE* | TIME COST |
|-------------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Level 1 | 50k $p | 25k $p | 1 month |
| Level 2 | 125k $p | 50k $p | 2 months |
| Level 3 | 250k $p | 100k $p | 4 months |
| Level 4 | 500k $p | 200k $p | 8 months |
| Level 5 | 1m $p | 400k $p | 2 years |

*x2 Material Fee = ½ Time

### Formula Flaws

**Roll 1d10:**
1. The spell can only target the caster.
2. The spell only works on willing targets.
3. The formula is unchanged, but you gain no cumulative +1 bonus on the research roll for this or prior research continuations.
4. The spell can only target people other than the caster.
5. The spell is slow & requires a Main Action to cast (2 Main Actions over 2 successive Rounds if it already required a Main Action).
6. The spell is very draining, exhausting 2 spells worth of energy for the day instead of 1.
7. The spell inflicts 1d4 Strain when cast. If this maxes their Strain they fall unconscious for 10 min.
8. The spell is 1 level > expected (does not increase research costs or time). The project fails if unable to cast a spell of that level.
9. The spell is simply unreliable. When cast, roll 1d6. On a 1, the spell fizzles uselessly & the casting slot is wasted.
10. The whole attempt was a mistake. All progress & research materials are lost & everything must be done over from the start.

### Creating Magical Items
- Permanent magic items require ≥ 1 adventure to acquire the required components.
- Int/Magic Skill check to create. Success: Item is created. Failure: Initial time & money is lost. PCs roll for Item Flaw.
- PCs can quit or continue w/ the flawed item, spending ½ the original time, no additional coin, & receiving a +1 bonus.
- PCs can repeat this process adding flaws & paying ½ the original time until successful or they abandon the project.

### Magic Item Creation Costs

| TYPE OF MAGICAL ITEM | DC | Creation Cost | Creation Time |
|----------------------|----|---------------|---------------|
| Single-use item | 8–10 | 250–2.5k $p | 1 week |
| Multi-use item w/ limited charges | 9–11 | 5k –25k $p | 1 month |
| Low-powered but permanent magic item | 10 | 12.5k $p | 1 month |
| Significant item w/ a situation changing effect | 12 | 50k $p | 3 months |
| Powerful item or one w/ multiple significant abilities | 14 | 250k $p | 6 months |

**Modifiers:**
- 2 doses of single use item: -1 penalty
- 4 doses of single use item: -2
- Magic-0 Apprentice: +1

### Calyxes
- A calyx is a magic effect trapped in an object for later use (scroll, tablet…) Mages can't learn spells from these.
- Any literate in the language of its inscription can decipher its content. If not, 1 day's study by someone w/ Magic-0 is required.
- A calyx holds ≥ 1 spell. Each spell can be cast once (unless duplicates are embedded in the same calyx) before it's destroyed.
- Spells are cast @ the level of the mage who inscribed them. Assume original Mage's level = highest level spell's required casting level.
- Using a calyx requires holding it & a Main Action. No vocalizations or gestures are needed. Calyxes are not restricted by armor or shield usage. If struck or jostled while casting the spell is wasted.
- A spellcaster can't use their own arts to boost a spell embedded in a calyx. It must be cast in its normal, unmodified form.
- User's Magic Skill must be ≥ the spell's level -1 to trigger it safely, otherwise Int/Magic or Cha/Magic Skill check is needed.
- DC = 8 + spell's level. Failure by ≤ 2: the spell is wasted. Failure by >2: its cast, but @ the wrong target or wrong effect.
- **Crafting Calyxes**: Cost = 1k $p x Spell Level, DC7 + ½ Spell Level ↑. Requires 1 week to craft & 1 week x Spell Level before another can be.

### Exemplars
- Exemplars are arcane artifacts that provide deep magical insight. Obvious on close inspection by a PC w/t ≤ Magic-0.
- Exemplars reduce the cost of creating Workings, spell research, or magic item creation by an amount = to their value. Once its $p value is exhausted, it is destroyed.
- Minor, Major, & Great refer to the power of Exemplars possible to be found in an area.

| d20 → | 1–7 | 8-13 | 14–17 | 18–19 | 20 |
|-------|-----|------|-------|-------|-----|
| Minor | 1k $p | 2k $p | 10k $p | 20k $p | 50k $p |
| Major | 10k $p | 20k $p | 100k $p | 200k $p | 500k $p |
| Great | 20k $p | 40k $p | 200k $p | 400k $p | 1m $p |

### Sentient Magic Weaponry
- Rare. Possess their own intellect & will directed toward carrying out a task chosen by its creator.
- Sentient weapons have ≥ 1 additional special ability related to their purpose, chosen by the GM.
- Some can vocally or telepathically communicate w/ their bearer, though not all speak modern languages.
- Bearers who offend the weapon must make an appropriate Cha/Stab or Shoot Skill check against DC 8 + the weapon's magical bonus in order to force its obedience for the day. Failure = weapon is treated as non magical for the rest of the day.
- Weapons that have a now-impossible purpose may try to reinterpret their function as a pursuable task. Most will not demand constant cooperation. Bearers who do not aid, or work counter to its purpose, will likely be unable to wield it.

### Magic Weapons
- Magic weapon bonuses are added to attack rolls, Damage rolls, & Shock dam, but do not stack w/ Masterwork bonuses.
- Crafting Magical weapons requires a Mage & a Masterwork Item to Enchant. 3 Effects per item max.

**Adamantine**: Unbreakable by all conventional & most magical means.

**Augmented**: weapon's enchantment hit & damage bonus increase by +1 to a max of +4.

**Blighted**: Created to slaughter a specific type of creature. Rolls damage x2 & takes the better vs them.

**Bloodbound**: weapon & wielder form a symbiosis. While wielding the weapon they regen 1HP/hr as magical healing. Also allows a reroll of a failed Save 1/day.

**Bloodthirsty**: When the wielder reduces a foe to 0HP, they regain 1d8 + the creature's HD in lost HP (can't exceed max HP).

**Despairing**: weapon drains a victim's courage. By taking 1 Strain as an Instant Action when they hit a target, they can force the victim to make an immediate Morale check @ a -1 penalty. This effect can be applied to a target 1/scene.

**Energetic**: Covered in flames, ice… Minor enchantment: +2 damage. Major enchantment: +1d6+2 damage (not applied to Shock).

**Enervating**: Phys Save or they lose their next Move Action (can't affect a creature again until their next turn).

**Enraging**: On Turn Action to rage. Gain +2 to hit & damage, reroll failed Mental Saves, continue fighting 1 Round after falling to 0HP, & auto succeed Morale checks. Each round wielder must attack, move to attack, or spend their Main Action to end the rage.

**Forfending**: The 1st Screen Ally Check each Round auto succeeds. Screened allies are immune to Shock & gain +2AC.

**Fortifying**: The weapon can hold ≤ 3 Strain in place of its bearer. Its Strain decreases 1 point per night.

**Hunting**: Against non-sentient beasts, the weapon rolls damage x2 & takes the higher.

**Illuminating**: Casts 60' of light at the wielder's mental command. +1 Strain to make the light visible only to the bearer & their allies (lasts 1hr).

**Longarm**: A ranged weapon's effective range is doubled.

**Lucky**: As an Instant Action, 1/scene the wielder can call on their luck to reroll an attack roll, damage roll, or Skill check made during combat, & take the better. When used they roll 1d6 as well; on a 1, the attempted roll fails or rolls min damage instead.

**Merciful**: weapon never kills any target it reduces to 0HP; instead, they are immediately stabilized & will awaken 1hr later w/ 1HP. This weapon's damage is painless & leaves no visible marks.

**Negating**: When the bearer is targeted by magic, they may accept 1 point of Strain as an Instant Action & make a Phys Save. Success = they are unaffected. Save may only be attempted once per instance of effect.

**Nightwalking**: weapon allows the bearer to step through shadows, entering 1 & appearing in another ≤ 100' away as a Move Action. Even very small shadows will suffice, & 1 is generally available in any area not devoid of light or objects to cast them.

**Omened**: 1/day the weapon can provide a yes, no, or unclear answer to a single question asked by a wielder regarding events that could happen to them w/in 1hr. GM answers to the best of their ability, but players' actions may change the outcome.

**Penetrating**: This weapon ignores mundane armor, shields, beast hides… for purposes of determining Shock susceptibility.

**Phantom**: As an On Turn Action, the bearer can turn the weapon invisible & intangible to anyone but themselves or revert it to normal. While invisible, the weapon can harm only intangible or immaterial foes & can't be detected or touched by others.

**Phasing**: The weapon can be tuned to pass through solid obstacles @ will. Causing the weapon to phase is an On Turn Action that adds 1 point of Strain to the bearer. Until the end of the Round the weapon ignores any armor, cover, or barriers.

**Piercing**: This weapon inflicts Shock damage on anything attacked w/ it, even if a target is immune to Shock. However, the weapon never inflicts > its Shock damage. If the weapon doesn't normally do Shock, it gains a base Shock rating of 2/-.

**Rampaging**: Whenever this weapon kills a creature w/ ≤ 1HD, its bearer may immediately make another attack on a target w/in range. If no additional targets are available, the wielder instead gets an instant free Move Action.

**Rectifying**: damage to undead, robots, or synthetic life is rolled x2 & the better taken. It can affect insubstantial or otherwise immune entities of the types, & undead killed by it are permanently dead barring tremendous revivification or immortality.

**Returning**: If thrown, dropped, or disarmed, the weapon can be called back to the owner's hand as an On Turn Action. A new possessor becomes the owner after carrying it for ≥ 1hr.

**Sacrificial**: As an Instant Action on a hit, the wielder may take 1d8 damage & deal x2 that damage to the target. This damage may be enough to mortally wound the weapon's own wielder.

**Shield Breaking**: The weapon ignores all shields, both their AC bonus & their Shock protection. Mundane shields are destroyed by the weapon's attack, whether or not the attack hits.

**Shocking**: The weapon's Shock damage is increased by +2. If it has no natural Shock score, it gains a Shock rating of 2/AC 15.

**Skittering**: 1/Round when the weapon is shot or thrown at a spot w/in 60', the wielder can instantly appear where the weapon was thrown or struck as an On Turn Action (must do so in the same Round). If thrown they appear w/ the weapon in hand.

**Skytreading**: The weapon's bearer falls gently from any height, becoming immune to falling damage. By accepting 1 point of Strain as an On Turn Action, they may fly at their full normal movement rate until the end of the Round.

**Slaughtering**: Any foe brought to 0HP by the weapon is immediately killed & violently dismembered. Any enemies w/ a Morale score of < 12 w/in melee range of the victim take the weapon's Shock damage from horror, even if normally immune to Shock.

**Souleating**: 1/scene when the wielder kills a sentient foe w/ the weapon, they lose 1 point of Strain

**Spellcleaving**: 1/scene @ a cost of a Move Action & +1 Strain to the wielder, the weapon can apply a Dispel magic spell effect to any target point w/in its range. The spell is cast as if by a 10th level High Mage w/ a total Int/Magic Skill bonus of +3.

### Magic Armor
- Crafting Magical Armor & Shields requires a Mage & a Masterwork Item to Enchant. 2 Effects per item max.
- Armor's enchantment is measured from +1 to +3, which is added to its base AC. They can also possess magical abilities.
- Typically masterwork quality, so Є = 1 < the base armor (not for purposes of the Armored Magic Foci' limits). Most magic armor is adjustable to most humanoid wearers.
- The magic of a shield does not increase its AC bonus. Instead, they're empowered w/ unique abilities, & can't be shattered in combat.
- Abilities & bonuses granted by magical equipment do not stack.

**Augmented**: The bearer can carry four more points of Readied encumbrance. 1/scene, they can lift or briefly manipulate w/ brute strength anything a human possibly could.

**Bracing**: As a Move Action, the bearer can brace against one specific foe. Until they voluntarily move from their location, they're immune to Shock from that foe & can't be forcibly moved.

**Casting (HB)**: A War Shirt may be enchanted to allow a spellcaster the use of Spells & Arts unhindered while it is worn.

**Clotting**: 1/day, it automatically stabilizes an Mortally Wounded bearer.

**Feathery**: The user is immune to falling damage & can choose a landing site w/in 30 feet of their target.

**Feral**: At the cost of 1 Strain, the bearer can talk to animals for 1 scene who will reply w/ human intellect but bestial interests.

**Fireproof**: The bearer ignores the 1st 10 points of fire or heat damage they suffer each Round.

**Fortified**: The bearer ignores the 1st point of Strain they'd otherwise incur in a day.

**Graceful**: The bearer leaves no tracks & can't slip, trip, or be subject to forced movement by any man-sized foes.

**Harmonic**: An allied mage can cast a spell on it; the bearer is then immune to that spell until it is changed.

**Impervious**: 1/Round, the bearer ignores an instance of Shock they would otherwise have suffered.

**Inspiring**: Allies who can see the wearer gain a +1 Morale bonus & may reroll failed Mental Saves against emotion or thought-controlling effects.

**Lucky**: 1/day, as an Instant Action, turn a failed save into a success.

**Majestic**: Its magnificent appearance makes it socially acceptable wear in any situation or context.

**Sealed**: The bearer ignores toxic atmospheres, terrestrial temperature extremes, & has no need to breathe.

**Shifting**: The bearer can teleport up to 30' to a visible location as a Move Action.

**Shining**: It can emit light in a 30' radius at will. 1/day, On Turn Action, dazzle a melee foe to force a Phys Save or they lose their next Main Action.

**Silent**: It applies no penalty to Sneak Skill checks. If light armor or a shield, it grants a +1 bonus to the checks.

**Soaring**: Main action to move x2 their move rate through the air. They'll fall if they end the turn on an unsupported surface.

**Sustaining**: 1/day, cause the bearer to gain +1 Strain & lose all need for sleep, food, air, or drink for the next 24hrs.

**Thorned**: Successful grapple or unarmed attacks vs the wearer also inflict 1d6 damage to the attacker, plus any armor enhancement bonus.

**Transient**: It can vanish from its wearer & return as an On Turn Action 1/Round. It appears if they go unconscious or die.

**Unsleeping**: The bearer need not sleep, but will not get the benefits of a night's rest unless they do so.

**Vigilant**: The bearer can see normally even in deep mists or total darkness. They can't be surprised.

**Warded**: The GM chooses one weapon entry from the table on page 37. Non-magic weapons of that kind can't hurt the bearer, & magic ones do only half damage ↓. Neither inflicts Shock.

**Weightless**: 0 Encumbrance (does not apply to the Armored Magic Focus' limits or the armor's usual Skill check penalties).

### Cursed Items
- If a GM decides a risk exists: 1 in 20 chance the weapon is cursed.
- If an owner is separated from a binding cursed item, they can't lose Strain & gain +1 point each night until the item's return.
- A Dispel magic spell can disentangle the curse, but other times more elaborate magics or adventures are required.
- An item's curse makes the item dangerous or harmful to use, but not so awful that the party would discard it out of hand.

### Cursed Weapons & Armor

**Clumsy**: If the bearer doesn't choose to act last in initiative order, they can't use this item or attack w/ it.

**Draining**: Each scene in which the item is used, the bearer gains one System Strain.

**Enfeebled**: The weapon never inflicts Shock, regardless of the wielder's abilities or the target's AC.

**Heavy**: The item is x2 the usual Encumbrance cost.

**Ill-Omened**: Its bearer always fails saving throws on a roll of 19 or 20.

**Infuriating**: When carried, the bearer suffers +2 to all social check difficulties & a -1 penalty to the party's reaction rolls.

**Mundane**: May have hit & damage bonuses, it isn't counted as a magical weapon for purposes of affecting mundane-immune targets.

**Poisonous**: The user suffers 1d6 damage from its toxic substance or malign radiations at the end of each scene in which they use it.

**Refractory**: At the start of each scene that its bearer chooses to use it, roll 1d6. 1 = it refuses to work for the rest of the day.

**Screaming**: The item makes tremendous noise when used, making stealth impossible & possibly forcing a Wandering Encounter check.

**Traitorous**: On a nat 1 attack roll, the weapon strikes its owner. If armor is cursed, foes always hit on a 1 on the hit roll.
