### Arts & Effort
- Arts are fueled by Committing Effort. A PC's Class determines from whence Effort is based.
- Typically: Skill + Attribute Modifier + 1 (if Full Class) = Max Effort.
- **Committed Effort for the Scene** = Recharges after 1 Scene.
- **Committed Effort Indefinite** = Returned once you "turn off" an Art instantly.
- **Committed Effort for the Day** = Recharges after 1 Night's Rest.

### Preparing & Casting Spells
- A mage can prepare any spell from their spellbook after 1 night's rest. This takes approx 1hr.
- Spells typically require a Main Action, free hand, & vocalization as loud as conversation. Casting is obvious, but which spell isn't.
- Spells typically require line of sight w/ the target, unless line of sight would defeat the purpose of the spell (i.e. scrying, etc).
- Spells typically require a willing or helpless target, otherwise the target is allowed a Save to reduce or negate the effects.
- Spells typically last until dispelled by choice as an Instant action by the caster, or by force, such as the caster falling unconscious or dying, exceeding the spell's time limits, or exceeding its limitations (i.e. violent motion while invisible, etc).
- If a mage takes damage or is severely jostled they can't cast spells until their next turn. Damage does not interrupt Arts.
- Whether Spells or Arts can be cast while in armor will depend on the Class restrictions.
- The same spell may be cast > once if the mage has multiple castings left for the day.
- Partial Mages apply their full character level to any level-based effects from spells.

### Learning Spells
- Spellcasting full Mages begin w/ 4 1st level spells & Partial Mages w/ 2. Spells may be chosen from any spell list available to them.
- Some Mages gain new spells @ level up. High Mages pick 2 High Magic spells they are able to cast. Necromancers & Elementalists pick only 1, but can choose from High Magic spells or spells from their tradition. Partial Mages that are capable of casting spells learn spells just as full Mages do.
- Learning a spell from a grimoire = (1 week x Spell Level) - (1 week x Level of the Mage's Magic Skill). Min of 1 day.
- A PC must be capable of casting the spell to learn it.

### Grimoires
- Looted grimoires contain a # of spells to learn = to the level of its initial owner (assumed to be highest level spell's required casting level).
- To select spells, pick a 1st level spell, then continue picking spells successively until reaching the highest level spell the original owner could cast. Start over @ level 1 spells & continue like this until a # of spells have been chosen = to the original Mage's level.
- Some grimoires contain curses, & some spells contain flaws.

### Developing New Spells
- Int/Magic check = DC10 + Spell's Level. Magic-0 Apprentice: +1 bonus. Mage researching New Magic of their specialty: +1 bonus.
- On success the spell is created. On failure the initial time & money is lost & PCs must roll on the Formula Flaw table.
- PCs decide to quit or continue w/ the flawed spell, spending ½ the original time, no additional coin, & gaining a +1 bonus.
- PCs can repeat this process adding flaws & paying ½ the original time until successful or until they abandon the project.

**Spell design guidelines:**

- Spells should not substitute for other classes.
- Spells should not offer simple numeric bonuses.
- Spells should not offer cheap & easy combat damage.
- Spells that buff a target shouldn't last > a scene.
- Spells should not create permanent magical effects or valuable matter.
- Spells should not be petty.

### Spell Development Costs

| SPELL LEVEL | LAB FEE | MATERIAL FEE* | TIME COST |
|-------------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Level 1 | 50k $p | 25k $p | 1 month |
| Level 2 | 125k $p | 50k $p | 2 months |
| Level 3 | 250k $p | 100k $p | 4 months |
| Level 4 | 500k $p | 200k $p | 8 months |
| Level 5 | 1m $p | 400k $p | 2 years |

*x2 Material Fee = ½ Time

### Formula Flaws

**Roll 1d10:**
1. The spell can only target the caster.
2. The spell only works on willing targets.
3. The formula is unchanged, but you gain no cumulative +1 bonus on the research roll for this or prior research continuations.
4. The spell can only target people other than the caster.
5. The spell is slow & requires a Main Action to cast (2 Main Actions over 2 successive Rounds if it already required a Main Action).
6. The spell is very draining, exhausting 2 spells worth of energy for the day instead of 1.
7. The spell inflicts 1d4 Strain when cast. If this maxes their Strain they fall unconscious for 10 min.
8. The spell is 1 level > expected (does not increase research costs or time). The project fails if unable to cast a spell of that level.
9. The spell is simply unreliable. When cast, roll 1d6. On a 1, the spell fizzles uselessly & the casting slot is wasted.
10. The whole attempt was a mistake. All progress & research materials are lost & everything must be done over from the start.
