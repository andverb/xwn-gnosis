## Magical Devices

Arcane objects of wonder. Below are listed only a small section of possibilities.

**Censer of Solid Dreams**: Lasts 1 scene. Main Action. 1/day when filled w/ fuel & lit it exhales smoke that the bearer can mold w/ mental commands into a solid, simple object ≤ 30' cube. It is opaque & requires 5HP of damage to punch a human-sized hole through it. Creatures caught w/in the smoke can tear through it w/ a Main Action. Can bear the weight of horses.

**Congealed Paradox**: Main Action. When broken, active magic w/in 20' is dispelled & no further spells, arts, or magic power use can be performed inside it for 1 scene. Creatures reliant on magic to exist take 5d6 damage each Round spent w/in its AoE.

**Enough Rope**: Always be precisely long enough for the task at hand. The rope can bear ≤ 1 ton & can't be cut by mundane means. So long as the owner is touching the rope, they can cause it to untie itself or retract fully back into their grip.

**Eye of Discernment**: An eye made of jade. It can penetrate any mundane disguise or magical spell x1 before turning to dust.

**Flask of Devils**: 1/day, if opened, a devil leaps from the bottle (stats = to a creature of the Calculation of the Phantasmal Eidolon spell). The devil demands its liberator give it a command, which is followed until the scene is over or task completed. Once completed it returns into the flask. Use of the flask adds +1 Strain, +1d3 if the devil is killed (a new devil will be summoned the next time the flask is opened). If this Strain puts the user over their max, they're dragged into the flask to become its new devil.

**Ghost Horse**: A fist-sized crystal that manifests a crystal steed. Main Action to summon. Can carry its summoner + 35Є for 12hrs before needing an = amount of time to recharge. Move 60'. Can cross any terrain a mountain goat or small boat could. Natural animals shy away from the beast. 13AC, 10HP, can't fight, & if destroyed it collapses back into its crystal. Can't be recalled for 1 wk.

**Immanent Beacon Shard**: When activated & released the crystal remains fixed precisely in that location. No mundane force can shift or damage it. DC12 to dispel the effect w/ magic. The person who placed the shard is aware of its location, & can see & hear the area around it. The user can reclaim the beacon at a cost of +1 Strain, or wait for the effect to wear out 1 day later.

**Implacable Fist**: Grants the user an inhuman grip strength. W/ 1 Round to build force it can crush any mundane material it grips. Magical materials require a Str/Exert check vs +8DC. Impractical to use as a weapon in combat or grappling. Any object carried in that hand has a 1 in 6 chance of being crushed accidentally by the wearer's reaction to combat or other sudden stress.

**Lens of the Polychrome Lord**: Palm-sized lenses concentrate light into a lethal beam. In direct sunlight the beam does 5d6 damage to a target w/in 300' (Evasion Save negates). In ordinary lighting the effect does 3d6, & if the chamber is dark save for portable light sources the damage is 1d6. If the lens is used > 1/day there is a 1 in 4 chance it shatters after each bolt.

**Lex Talionis**: Often daggers or the like, they function as ordinary +1 magical weapons, but when they harm a target the victim must make a Phys Save or both the target & the wielder instantly die, w/ no chance to stabilize. If the weapon is used as part of an Execution attack, no save. The weapon then vanishes.

**Logos**: No sentient can look upon a logos & not recognize its power. A mage can expend a logos as a substitute for > 250k $p worth of ingredients for creating magic items. If used to fuel a magic item's creation, no further special ingredients are required.

**Lyre of Longing**: 1/day when played by a competent musician for ≥ 5min, listeners w/in 30' must make a Mental Save or be seized by a desire for a particular thing or purpose imagined by the player. This longing will not make them act out of character, but they will perform all normally-conceivable actions in order to obtain the object of their longing, including quarreling fiercely w/ their fellows if this object can't be shared. The enchantment lasts 1 scene.

**Memorious Fragrance**: An incense stick that never burns out. Lighting the item as a Main Action allows the activator to spread a subtle haze of scented mist in a 20' radius. The user may then describe a memory they wish others to have; all w/in 20' except the user must make Mental Saves or have the memory implanted. They may not realize this memory exists unless brought to their attention or questioned about it. The memory persists until magically dispelled. This item can't alter or erase existing memories.

**Purification Salt**: If the salt is used on an object or weapon as a Main Action it can interact w/ incorporeal entities as if solid for 1 scene. If hurled it does 3d6 damage to mages, unnatural magical creatures, or incorporeal beings. If consumed by a creature, it fills the imbiber w/ a sense of guilt & sorrow, inflicting 3d6 emotional damage. Creatures reduced to 0HP regain 1HP but will attempt suicide. A pinch of salt can be taken from the bag each scene, but any existing pinches evaporate once a new one is taken.

**Rain-Beckoning Drum**: Produces an immediate deluge of rain in a 100' radius around the user when it is beaten rhythmically. The rain lasts ≤ 1 Round but will drop 3" of water on all surfaces w/in the area of effect; if used indoors, the rain issues from the room's ceiling. The drum can be used safely 1/wk. Each additional time it is used in the same wk, it adds 1 Strain to the user.

**Seed of Flesh**: Main Action. Lasts 1 scene. This small, fleshy seed can be thrown & sprouts into a copy of the creature that threw it, albeit naked & unequipped, w/ 6 HP. It can't cast spells or use arts, but will obey even suicidal commands.

**Stonepeg**: These devices are always found in groups of 1d4+2 pegs, each appearing to be a glyphed metal rod ~1' in length w/ a chisel-shaped tip. If thrust firmly into a stone or earthen surface, the peg will effortlessly sink into the material & become as firm & fixed as if it were cemented in place. The peg can only be freely removed by the person who sank it into place, otherwise requiring that it be chiseled out w/ a scene's Effort & the correct tools.

**Stutter Hatchet**: +1 hand axe. Inanimate matter damaged by the hatchet will return to its unbroken state @ dawn if the flat of the axe is tapped against its largest fragment of it. If destroyed thoroughly fragments may be missing from the reformed object.

**Vessel of Hours**: Instant Action. The bearer can invoke this clock-like object to undo their actions & any consequences for the immediate turn, resetting their turn back to its beginning. This object & others of its kind will only work once for any given user.

**Vothite Icon**: Range: 30'. Requires 1 free hand & LoS. Main Action. When a human/demihuman 1st sees this incomprehensible icon, they must make a Mental Save. Failure = loss of their next Round's Action. Can't affect the same creature x2.
