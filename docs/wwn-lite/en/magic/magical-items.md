### Calyxes
- A calyx is a magic effect trapped in an object for later use (scroll, tablet…) Mages can't learn spells from these.
- Any literate in the language of its inscription can decipher its content. If not, 1 day's study by someone w/ Magic-0 is required.
- A calyx holds ≥ 1 spell. Each spell can be cast once (unless duplicates are embedded in the same calyx) before it's destroyed.
- Spells are cast @ the level of the mage who inscribed them. Assume original Mage's level = highest level spell's required casting level.
- Using a calyx requires holding it & a Main Action. No vocalizations or gestures are needed. Calyxes are not restricted by armor or shield usage. If struck or jostled while casting the spell is wasted.
- A spellcaster can't use their own arts to boost a spell embedded in a calyx. It must be cast in its normal, unmodified form.
- User's Magic Skill must be ≥ the spell's level -1 to trigger it safely, otherwise Int/Magic or Cha/Magic Skill check is needed.
- DC = 8 + spell's level. Failure by ≤ 2: the spell is wasted. Failure by >2: its cast, but @ the wrong target or wrong effect.

**Crafting Calyxes**: 
- Cost = 1k $p x Spell Level.
- DC7 + ½ Spell Level ↑. 
- Requires 1 week to craft & 1 week x Spell Level before another can be.

### Exemplars
- Exemplars are arcane artifacts that provide deep magical insight. Obvious on close inspection by a PC w/t ≤ Magic-0.
- Exemplars reduce the cost of creating Workings, spell research, or magic item creation by an amount = to their value. Once its $p value is exhausted, it is destroyed.
- Minor, Major, & Great refer to the power of Exemplars possible to be found in an area.

| d20 → | 1–7 | 8-13 | 14–17 | 18–19 | 20 |
|-------|-----|------|-------|-------|-----|
| Minor | 1k $p | 2k $p | 10k $p | 20k $p | 50k $p |
| Major | 10k $p | 20k $p | 100k $p | 200k $p | 500k $p |
| Great | 20k $p | 40k $p | 200k $p | 400k $p | 1m $p |

### Sentient Magic Weaponry
- Rare. Possess their own intellect & will directed toward carrying out a task chosen by its creator.
- Sentient weapons have ≥ 1 additional special ability related to their purpose, chosen by the GM.
- Some can vocally or telepathically communicate w/ their bearer, though not all speak modern languages.
- Bearers who offend the weapon must make an appropriate Cha/Stab or Shoot Skill check against DC 8 + the weapon's magical bonus in order to force its obedience for the day. Failure = weapon is treated as non magical for the rest of the day.
- Weapons that have a now-impossible purpose may try to reinterpret their function as a pursuable task. Most will not demand constant cooperation. Bearers who do not aid, or work counter to its purpose, will likely be unable to wield it.

### Magic Weapons
- Magic weapon bonuses are added to attack rolls, Damage rolls, & Shock dam, but do not stack w/ Masterwork bonuses.
- Crafting Magical weapons requires a Mage & a Masterwork Item to Enchant. 3 Effects per item max.

**Adamantine**: Unbreakable by all conventional & most magical means.

**Augmented**: weapon's enchantment hit & damage bonus increase by +1 to a max of +4.

**Blighted**: Created to slaughter a specific type of creature. Rolls damage x2 & takes the better vs them.

**Bloodbound**: weapon & wielder form a symbiosis. While wielding the weapon they regen 1HP/hr as magical healing. Also allows a reroll of a failed Save 1/day.

**Bloodthirsty**: When the wielder reduces a foe to 0HP, they regain 1d8 + the creature's HD in lost HP (can't exceed max HP).

**Despairing**: weapon drains a victim's courage. By taking 1 Strain as an Instant Action when they hit a target, they can force the victim to make an immediate Morale check @ a -1 penalty. This effect can be applied to a target 1/scene.

**Energetic**: Covered in flames, ice… Minor enchantment: +2 damage. Major enchantment: +1d6+2 damage (not applied to Shock).

**Enervating**: Phys Save or they lose their next Move Action (can't affect a creature again until their next turn).

**Enraging**: On Turn Action to rage. Gain +2 to hit & damage, reroll failed Mental Saves, continue fighting 1 Round after falling to 0HP, & auto succeed Morale checks. Each round wielder must attack, move to attack, or spend their Main Action to end the rage.

**Forfending**: The 1st Screen Ally Check each Round auto succeeds. Screened allies are immune to Shock & gain +2AC.

**Fortifying**: The weapon can hold ≤ 3 Strain in place of its bearer. Its Strain decreases 1 point per night.

**Hunting**: Against non-sentient beasts, the weapon rolls damage x2 & takes the higher.

**Illuminating**: Casts 60' of light at the wielder's mental command. +1 Strain to make the light visible only to the bearer & their allies (lasts 1hr).

**Longarm**: A ranged weapon's effective range is doubled.

**Lucky**: As an Instant Action, 1/scene the wielder can call on their luck to reroll an attack roll, damage roll, or Skill check made during combat, & take the better. When used they roll 1d6 as well; on a 1, the attempted roll fails or rolls min damage instead.

**Merciful**: weapon never kills any target it reduces to 0HP; instead, they are immediately stabilized & will awaken 1hr later w/ 1HP. This weapon's damage is painless & leaves no visible marks.

**Negating**: When the bearer is targeted by magic, they may accept 1 point of Strain as an Instant Action & make a Phys Save. Success = they are unaffected. Save may only be attempted once per instance of effect.

**Nightwalking**: weapon allows the bearer to step through shadows, entering 1 & appearing in another ≤ 100' away as a Move Action. Even very small shadows will suffice, & 1 is generally available in any area not devoid of light or objects to cast them.

**Omened**: 1/day the weapon can provide a yes, no, or unclear answer to a single question asked by a wielder regarding events that could happen to them w/in 1hr. GM answers to the best of their ability, but players' actions may change the outcome.

**Penetrating**: This weapon ignores mundane armor, shields, beast hides… for purposes of determining Shock susceptibility.

**Phantom**: As an On Turn Action, the bearer can turn the weapon invisible & intangible to anyone but themselves or revert it to normal. While invisible, the weapon can harm only intangible or immaterial foes & can't be detected or touched by others.

**Phasing**: The weapon can be tuned to pass through solid obstacles @ will. Causing the weapon to phase is an On Turn Action that adds 1 point of Strain to the bearer. Until the end of the Round the weapon ignores any armor, cover, or barriers.

**Piercing**: This weapon inflicts Shock damage on anything attacked w/ it, even if a target is immune to Shock. However, the weapon never inflicts > its Shock damage. If the weapon doesn't normally do Shock, it gains a base Shock rating of 2/-.

**Rampaging**: Whenever this weapon kills a creature w/ ≤ 1HD, its bearer may immediately make another attack on a target w/in range. If no additional targets are available, the wielder instead gets an instant free Move Action.

**Rectifying**: damage to undead, robots, or synthetic life is rolled x2 & the better taken. It can affect insubstantial or otherwise immune entities of the types, & undead killed by it are permanently dead barring tremendous revivification or immortality.

**Returning**: If thrown, dropped, or disarmed, the weapon can be called back to the owner's hand as an On Turn Action. A new possessor becomes the owner after carrying it for ≥ 1hr.

**Sacrificial**: As an Instant Action on a hit, the wielder may take 1d8 damage & deal x2 that damage to the target. This damage may be enough to mortally wound the weapon's own wielder.

**Shield Breaking**: The weapon ignores all shields, both their AC bonus & their Shock protection. Mundane shields are destroyed by the weapon's attack, whether or not the attack hits.

**Shocking**: The weapon's Shock damage is increased by +2. If it has no natural Shock score, it gains a Shock rating of 2/AC 15.

**Skittering**: 1/Round when the weapon is shot or thrown at a spot w/in 60', the wielder can instantly appear where the weapon was thrown or struck as an On Turn Action (must do so in the same Round). If thrown they appear w/ the weapon in hand.

**Skytreading**: The weapon's bearer falls gently from any height, becoming immune to falling damage. By accepting 1 point of Strain as an On Turn Action, they may fly at their full normal movement rate until the end of the Round.

**Slaughtering**: Any foe brought to 0HP by the weapon is immediately killed & violently dismembered. Any enemies w/ a Morale score of < 12 w/in melee range of the victim take the weapon's Shock damage from horror, even if normally immune to Shock.

**Souleating**: 1/scene when the wielder kills a sentient foe w/ the weapon, they lose 1 point of Strain

**Spellcleaving**: 1/scene @ a cost of a Move Action & +1 Strain to the wielder, the weapon can apply a Dispel magic spell effect to any target point w/in its range. The spell is cast as if by a 10th level High Mage w/ a total Int/Magic Skill bonus of +3.

### Magic Armor
- Crafting Magical Armor & Shields requires a Mage & a Masterwork Item to Enchant. 2 Effects per item max.
- Armor's enchantment is measured from +1 to +3, which is added to its base AC. They can also possess magical abilities.
- Typically masterwork quality, so Є = 1 < the base armor (not for purposes of the Armored Magic Foci' limits). Most magic armor is adjustable to most humanoid wearers.
- The magic of a shield does not increase its AC bonus. Instead, they're empowered w/ unique abilities, & can't be shattered in combat.
- Abilities & bonuses granted by magical equipment do not stack.

**Augmented**: The bearer can carry four more points of Readied encumbrance. 1/scene, they can lift or briefly manipulate w/ brute strength anything a human possibly could.

**Bracing**: As a Move Action, the bearer can brace against one specific foe. Until they voluntarily move from their location, they're immune to Shock from that foe & can't be forcibly moved.

**Casting (HB)**: A War Shirt may be enchanted to allow a spellcaster the use of Spells & Arts unhindered while it is worn.

**Clotting**: 1/day, it automatically stabilizes an Mortally Wounded bearer.

**Feathery**: The user is immune to falling damage & can choose a landing site w/in 30 feet of their target.

**Feral**: At the cost of 1 Strain, the bearer can talk to animals for 1 scene who will reply w/ human intellect but bestial interests.

**Fireproof**: The bearer ignores the 1st 10 points of fire or heat damage they suffer each Round.

**Fortified**: The bearer ignores the 1st point of Strain they'd otherwise incur in a day.

**Graceful**: The bearer leaves no tracks & can't slip, trip, or be subject to forced movement by any man-sized foes.

**Harmonic**: An allied mage can cast a spell on it; the bearer is then immune to that spell until it is changed.

**Impervious**: 1/Round, the bearer ignores an instance of Shock they would otherwise have suffered.

**Inspiring**: Allies who can see the wearer gain a +1 Morale bonus & may reroll failed Mental Saves against emotion or thought-controlling effects.

**Lucky**: 1/day, as an Instant Action, turn a failed save into a success.

**Majestic**: Its magnificent appearance makes it socially acceptable wear in any situation or context.

**Sealed**: The bearer ignores toxic atmospheres, terrestrial temperature extremes, & has no need to breathe.

**Shifting**: The bearer can teleport up to 30' to a visible location as a Move Action.

**Shining**: It can emit light in a 30' radius at will. 1/day, On Turn Action, dazzle a melee foe to force a Phys Save or they lose their next Main Action.

**Silent**: It applies no penalty to Sneak Skill checks. If light armor or a shield, it grants a +1 bonus to the checks.

**Soaring**: Main action to move x2 their move rate through the air. They'll fall if they end the turn on an unsupported surface.

**Sustaining**: 1/day, cause the bearer to gain +1 Strain & lose all need for sleep, food, air, or drink for the next 24hrs.

**Thorned**: Successful grapple or unarmed attacks vs the wearer also inflict 1d6 damage to the attacker, plus any armor enhancement bonus.

**Transient**: It can vanish from its wearer & return as an On Turn Action 1/Round. It appears if they go unconscious or die.

**Unsleeping**: The bearer need not sleep, but will not get the benefits of a night's rest unless they do so.

**Vigilant**: The bearer can see normally even in deep mists or total darkness. They can't be surprised.

**Warded**: The GM chooses one weapon entry from the table on page 37. Non-magic weapons of that kind can't hurt the bearer, & magic ones do only half damage ↓. Neither inflicts Shock.

**Weightless**: 0 Encumbrance (does not apply to the Armored Magic Focus' limits or the armor's usual Skill check penalties).

### Cursed Items
- If a GM decides a risk exists: 1 in 20 chance the weapon is cursed.
- If an owner is separated from a binding cursed item, they can't lose Strain & gain +1 point each night until the item's return.
- A Dispel magic spell can disentangle the curse, but other times more elaborate magics or adventures are required.
- An item's curse makes the item dangerous or harmful to use, but not so awful that the party would discard it out of hand.

### Cursed Weapons & Armor

**Clumsy**: If the bearer doesn't choose to act last in initiative order, they can't use this item or attack w/ it.

**Draining**: Each scene in which the item is used, the bearer gains one System Strain.

**Enfeebled**: The weapon never inflicts Shock, regardless of the wielder's abilities or the target's AC.

**Heavy**: The item is x2 the usual Encumbrance cost.

**Ill-Omened**: Its bearer always fails saving throws on a roll of 19 or 20.

**Infuriating**: When carried, the bearer suffers +2 to all social check difficulties & a -1 penalty to the party's reaction rolls.

**Mundane**: May have hit & damage bonuses, it isn't counted as a magical weapon for purposes of affecting mundane-immune targets.

**Poisonous**: The user suffers 1d6 damage from its toxic substance or malign radiations at the end of each scene in which they use it.

**Refractory**: At the start of each scene that its bearer chooses to use it, roll 1d6. 1 = it refuses to work for the rest of the day.

**Screaming**: The item makes tremendous noise when used, making stealth impossible & possibly forcing a Wandering Encounter check.

**Traitorous**: On a nat 1 attack roll, the weapon strikes its owner. If armor is cursed, foes always hit on a 1 on the hit roll.

### Elixirs

- Elixirs must be consumed as part of their activation, typically requiring a Main Action for a readied Elixir.
- An Elixir = 1Є when Readied. A GM may allow some to be packed together @ 0 Є but they'll be inaccessible in combat.
- Salves & unguents can't be applied to a hostile or resisting target.
- Identifying Elixirs requires a detection spell, legible label, tasting a drop to guess, or 1 day & a Wis or Int Magic check vs its creation DC. Only 1 chance. If elixir was tainted or fouled it may detect incorrectly.
- Elixirs aren't uncommon in dungeons. Purchasing them requires a relationship w/ a skilled brewer & a reason for them to brew.

**Anchoring Draught**: Range: 10mi. Lasts 24hrs. Main Action: Imbiber teleports back to the spot they drank the potion, along w/ any objects & willing or incapacitated creatures they are carrying.

**Bestial Form**: Lasts Death or dawn. Imbiber changes into an animal they choose (≤ a horse, ≥ a rat). They gain the creature's means of movement & speed, but retain their stats. Belongings meld w/ them & maintain their benefits. On Turn Action to end.

**Blood of Boiling Rage**: Lasts 1 Scene. Roll attacks & damage w/ Adv. Every Round imbiber must attack or move to attack. Main Action & Mental Save to end. On failure: spend the next Round raging before trying again. Can't cast spells while raging.

**Bodily Innervation**: Rare. Once every 3 days it can decrease current Strain by -3.

**Borrowed Flesh**: A creature may transfer ≤ 6HP into the elixir by willingly adding their own blood & accepting an = amount of damage. This fleshy slurry lasts 1 month, during which the brew can be poured on a wounded subject to restore as much HP as was charged into it. The flesh mending the wound is the same as the donor, but will assimilate w/in months.

**Cold Courage**: The user of this potion is filled w/ invincible confidence for 1 scene. They attack w/ a Skill check instead of an attack roll @ DC = ½ the foe's AC↓. They are immune to mental effects that alter emotions. While under this influence, however, the GM tracks their HP & damage taken. The player is told only when they hit 0HP.

**Congealed Winter**: When opened or shattered, every water-based liquid w/in 20' instantly flash-freezes ≥ 1' deep, fires in range are extinguished, & living creatures take 2d6 damage. Vs liquid or fiery creatures the damage is max.

**Energetic Impermeability**: Grants immunity to the next harmful energy that would injure the imbiber w/in 1 scene. Protects from mundane sources of the energy & subtracts 15 damage from each hit by a magical source of that power. Energy forms include thermal, electrical, radiation, or caustic. Kinetic, psychic, & spiritual forms still harm. Does not change once set by the initial harm deflected.

**Murderous Anointing**: When applied to a weapon it gains a brief semi-sentience bent on bloodshed. For 1 scene, the wielder can accept +1 Strain to reroll a failed attack roll w/ the weapon, 1/failed attack. The treated weapon can't be used for nonlethal strikes.

**Nectar of Immortality**: Each bottle consumed adds an additional 1d6 years to the subject's healthy lifespan & cures all but the most sorcerously-potent afflictions. The nectar can't do > x2 the subject's natural lifespan, & after each dose there is a 1-in-20 chance the subject perishes in a hideous welter of cancers & growths.

**Nepenthe**: 1/lifetime this liquid can relieve a subject from mental trauma & cure madness. Insanity wrought by magic requires a Mental Save. On failure the draught can't break the curse.

**Omened Visions**: Pale blue powder that allows the user to explore the immediate future. Their next 15 min will play out in their visions, their actions chosen as they wish & their most probable consequences made evident in the dreamlike fugue, assuming those consequences are evident w/in the next 15 min. While under this effect the subject is oblivious to the mundane world.

**Persistent Luminescence**: When applied or imbibed the target glows 30' (persists 1 week or until dispelled).

**Plasmic Molding**: When applied to a mundane object smaller than a large door it becomes malleable as clay for 1 scene. At the end of the scene, the material hardens back to its original consistency in whatever form it now takes. If taken by a living creature, they may reshape their own body to a degree, taking any appearance that a creature of their species might naturally have. This alteration lasts until dispelled or the user ends it, but they can't recover Strain while so altered.

**Quintessence of the Hour**: When imbibed, the user is whisked back to a perfect temporal parallel of time from their past, occupying the body they had for 1hr. They may do as they wish in that time & place, but if they die in that hour, they die in the present as well. At the hour's end their mind is returned to the present. Nothing that happened in the facsimile has any effect on true reality, but things they learned or observed during that hour may be retained.

**Sacrificial Strength**: When imbibed, the user is capable of channeling their own life force into the damage they do. One time w/in the next scene, as an Instant Action, they may sacrifice a # of HP of their choice when they damage a target. Every 4HP = +1d6 (5d6 max). The user must retain ≥ 1HP & the bonus damage can be applied to only 1 target of a damaging Action.

**Sanctified Healing**: When applied to a target, it heals 1d6+1 HP instantly.

**Scalding Breath**: The imbiber of this fluid can exhale it again as a Main Action to do 4d6 + level damage to all targets w/in a cone 30' long & wide. Victims make an Evasion Save for ½ damage. Different fluids produce different noxious exhalations. Flame, frost, poison, & radiation are not uncommon. Only 1 breath attack is allowed, & if not made w/in a scene the potion is wasted.

**Soul Sight**: If applied to a creature's eyes this salve inhibits tasks like reading, but not fighting, & allows the creature to see living entities as glowing colored outlines regardless of light or invisibility. They can identify individuals by their glow, & the glow reveals the subject's current mental state as described in 1 or 2 words. Lasts for 6 hrs or until rinsed from their eyes.

**Truthspeaking**: When applied to, the user must envision a specific query before anointing a restrained, willing, or helpless sentient target w/ the potion. The subject makes a Mental Save to resist. Failure = they tell the user a truthful, undeceptive answer to the question in < 5 sentences. Success = the elixir is tainted & instead the target will instead give the answer the user thinks is most plausible. The user can't discern the result of the target's save, except by their own good judgment of the answer.

**Wrathful Detonation**: These flasks are permanently sealed & when hurled w/ intention never miss. They detonate for 2d6 damage to all targets w/in 15', w/ a range of 60'. They will not explode by accident, & only 1 flask can be hurled at a time.

### Magical Devices

Arcane objects of wonder. Below are listed only a small section of possibilities.

**Censer of Solid Dreams**: Lasts 1 scene. Main Action. 1/day when filled w/ fuel & lit it exhales smoke that the bearer can mold w/ mental commands into a solid, simple object ≤ 30' cube. It is opaque & requires 5HP of damage to punch a human-sized hole through it. Creatures caught w/in the smoke can tear through it w/ a Main Action. Can bear the weight of horses.

**Congealed Paradox**: Main Action. When broken, active magic w/in 20' is dispelled & no further spells, arts, or magic power use can be performed inside it for 1 scene. Creatures reliant on magic to exist take 5d6 damage each Round spent w/in its AoE.

**Enough Rope**: Always be precisely long enough for the task at hand. The rope can bear ≤ 1 ton & can't be cut by mundane means. So long as the owner is touching the rope, they can cause it to untie itself or retract fully back into their grip.

**Eye of Discernment**: An eye made of jade. It can penetrate any mundane disguise or magical spell x1 before turning to dust.

**Flask of Devils**: 1/day, if opened, a devil leaps from the bottle (stats = to a creature of the Calculation of the Phantasmal Eidolon spell). The devil demands its liberator give it a command, which is followed until the scene is over or task completed. Once completed it returns into the flask. Use of the flask adds +1 Strain, +1d3 if the devil is killed (a new devil will be summoned the next time the flask is opened). If this Strain puts the user over their max, they're dragged into the flask to become its new devil.

**Ghost Horse**: A fist-sized crystal that manifests a crystal steed. Main Action to summon. Can carry its summoner + 35Є for 12hrs before needing an = amount of time to recharge. Move 60'. Can cross any terrain a mountain goat or small boat could. Natural animals shy away from the beast. 13AC, 10HP, can't fight, & if destroyed it collapses back into its crystal. Can't be recalled for 1 wk.

**Immanent Beacon Shard**: When activated & released the crystal remains fixed precisely in that location. No mundane force can shift or damage it. DC12 to dispel the effect w/ magic. The person who placed the shard is aware of its location, & can see & hear the area around it. The user can reclaim the beacon at a cost of +1 Strain, or wait for the effect to wear out 1 day later.

**Implacable Fist**: Grants the user an inhuman grip strength. W/ 1 Round to build force it can crush any mundane material it grips. Magical materials require a Str/Exert check vs +8DC. Impractical to use as a weapon in combat or grappling. Any object carried in that hand has a 1 in 6 chance of being crushed accidentally by the wearer's reaction to combat or other sudden stress.

**Lens of the Polychrome Lord**: Palm-sized lenses concentrate light into a lethal beam. In direct sunlight the beam does 5d6 damage to a target w/in 300' (Evasion Save negates). In ordinary lighting the effect does 3d6, & if the chamber is dark save for portable light sources the damage is 1d6. If the lens is used > 1/day there is a 1 in 4 chance it shatters after each bolt.

**Lex Talionis**: Often daggers or the like, they function as ordinary +1 magical weapons, but when they harm a target the victim must make a Phys Save or both the target & the wielder instantly die, w/ no chance to stabilize. If the weapon is used as part of an Execution attack, no save. The weapon then vanishes.

**Logos**: No sentient can look upon a logos & not recognize its power. A mage can expend a logos as a substitute for > 250k $p worth of ingredients for creating magic items. If used to fuel a magic item's creation, no further special ingredients are required.

**Lyre of Longing**: 1/day when played by a competent musician for ≥ 5min, listeners w/in 30' must make a Mental Save or be seized by a desire for a particular thing or purpose imagined by the player. This longing will not make them act out of character, but they will perform all normally-conceivable actions in order to obtain the object of their longing, including quarreling fiercely w/ their fellows if this object can't be shared. The enchantment lasts 1 scene.

**Memorious Fragrance**: An incense stick that never burns out. Lighting the item as a Main Action allows the activator to spread a subtle haze of scented mist in a 20' radius. The user may then describe a memory they wish others to have; all w/in 20' except the user must make Mental Saves or have the memory implanted. They may not realize this memory exists unless brought to their attention or questioned about it. The memory persists until magically dispelled. This item can't alter or erase existing memories.

**Purification Salt**: If the salt is used on an object or weapon as a Main Action it can interact w/ incorporeal entities as if solid for 1 scene. If hurled it does 3d6 damage to mages, unnatural magical creatures, or incorporeal beings. If consumed by a creature, it fills the imbiber w/ a sense of guilt & sorrow, inflicting 3d6 emotional damage. Creatures reduced to 0HP regain 1HP but will attempt suicide. A pinch of salt can be taken from the bag each scene, but any existing pinches evaporate once a new one is taken.

**Rain-Beckoning Drum**: Produces an immediate deluge of rain in a 100' radius around the user when it is beaten rhythmically. The rain lasts ≤ 1 Round but will drop 3" of water on all surfaces w/in the area of effect; if used indoors, the rain issues from the room's ceiling. The drum can be used safely 1/wk. Each additional time it is used in the same wk, it adds 1 Strain to the user.

**Seed of Flesh**: Main Action. Lasts 1 scene. This small, fleshy seed can be thrown & sprouts into a copy of the creature that threw it, albeit naked & unequipped, w/ 6 HP. It can't cast spells or use arts, but will obey even suicidal commands.

**Stonepeg**: These devices are always found in groups of 1d4+2 pegs, each appearing to be a glyphed metal rod ~1' in length w/ a chisel-shaped tip. If thrust firmly into a stone or earthen surface, the peg will effortlessly sink into the material & become as firm & fixed as if it were cemented in place. The peg can only be freely removed by the person who sank it into place, otherwise requiring that it be chiseled out w/ a scene's Effort & the correct tools.

**Stutter Hatchet**: +1 hand axe. Inanimate matter damaged by the hatchet will return to its unbroken state @ dawn if the flat of the axe is tapped against its largest fragment of it. If destroyed thoroughly fragments may be missing from the reformed object.

**Vessel of Hours**: Instant Action. The bearer can invoke this clock-like object to undo their actions & any consequences for the immediate turn, resetting their turn back to its beginning. This object & others of its kind will only work once for any given user.

**Vothite Icon**: Range: 30'. Requires 1 free hand & LoS. Main Action. When a human/demihuman 1st sees this incomprehensible icon, they must make a Mental Save. Failure = loss of their next Round's Action. Can't affect the same creature x2.
