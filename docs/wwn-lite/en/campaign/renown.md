## Renown

Renown is earned through deeds & used to complete Major Projects. A party earns a point of Renown each session they successfully:

- Accomplish a longstanding goal.
- Aid those in dire need.
- Best a major foe.
- Risk grave danger for glory or fortune.

### Major Projects
A Project's Renown Cost = Probability x Scope x Opposition.

| GOAL PROBABILITY | SCOPE AFFECTED | GREATEST OPPOSITION |
|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Plausible (1 Renown) | Village (x2) | Minor figures (x2) |
| Improbable (2 Renown) | City (x4) | Local leaders (x4) |
| Impossible (4 Renown) | Region (x8) | Major noble or beast (x8) |
| | Kingdom (x16) | King or famed monster (x16) |

*Multiply opposition by x2 if the local population is emotionally or socially against it.

**Cost can be lowered by influencing the probability, adjusting the scope, or nullifying the opposition.
