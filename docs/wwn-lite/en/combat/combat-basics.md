- When rolling an attack, the defender announces their AC so the roller knows if their Shock would apply.
- On a miss, a weapon inflicts Shock Damage if the target's AC is ≤ the Shock value of the weapon.
- A throwable weapon's Shock only applies to melee attacks.
- On a hit, the Damage can't be < the Shock Damage if the target would be susceptible to Shock Damage from the attack.

### Dual Wielding
- Requires Stab+1. +2 bonus to Damage (NOT Shock Damage). -1 To Hit. Choose which weapon hits. Unarmed can't dual-wield.
- Shields can be used for dual-wielding attacks, but grant no AC bonus or Shock protection until the wielder's next turn if used so.

### Mounted Combat
- Riders w/ < Ride-0 suffer -1 to hit. Longbows, rifles, & spells are unusable while riding.
- Mounts share their rider's Initiative, but have their own Main & Move Action, which they can split around their rider's actions.
- Mounting or dismounting requires a Move Action.
- Trained war-animals can attack, but ordinary riding beasts fight only in self-defense & require a Morale or Instinct check each Round or flee w/ their rider. A rider can force obedience w/ a Cha/Ride or Dex/Ride check made as a Move Action.
- A mount reduced to 0HP dumps its rider prone as it falls.

### Special Combat Maneuvers
Guidelines for adjudicating improvised combat actions.

- If the maneuver requires striking a foe w/ something, make it an attack roll to hit.
- If it requires manipulating an object around a foe, but not directly attacking him w/ it, let it be a Skill check or an opposed check.
- If it succeeds, damage caused should be ≥ the hero's usual weapon damage by +2 or +4 due to cleverness.
- If the effect is hindering rather than directly injurious, take away the foe's Main Action, or Move Action.
- Actions that could both hurt & hinder a foe may do lesser measures of both.
