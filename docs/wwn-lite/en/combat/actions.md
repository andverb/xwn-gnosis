### Action Types
**MAIN ACTION**: attack, manipulate a device, apply first aid, casting a spell…

**MOVE ACTION**: Climb, swim, crawl, difficult terrain… = ½ distance. In combat movement must be spent all @ once.

**ON TURN ACTION**: Fall prone, speak, draw a Readied object… Limit is @ GM's discretion.

**INSTANT ACTION**: Fast, simple. Can be made outside an actor's turn. Multiple Instants resolve in order GM decides.

### Common Combat Actions

**MAKE AN ATTACK (Main Action)**: Melee a foe w/in range or shoot a foe w/ a Ranged attack using a Readied weapon.

**CAST A SPELL (Main Action)**: If the caster has taken damage that Round, drawn or sheathed an item w/ their casting hand, or been badly jostled they can't take this Action. If damage is taken while casting the spell fizzles & the spell slot is wasted.

**USE A SKILL (Main Action)**: Perform a Skill that can be done in 6 secs (stabilize a wounded ally, turn a crank…)

**READY/STOW AN ITEM (Main Action)**: Draw a weapon or item from a pack. Changes from Readied to Stowed, or vice versa.

**SWARM ATTACK (Main Action)**:

- Each willing attacker takes this Act, targeting a foe w/in range.
- Once the final attacker has acted, 1 of the assailants makes an immediate attack (+2 to hit & +1 to damage for each additional assailant. Max +6/+3). Damage can't exceed the max of their normal attack, & is not applied to Shock.
- Even on a miss, Shock from the attack always harms the target regardless of their AC, if they're using a shield, or they have a Foci immunity to Shock. Total Defense however can prevent this Shock damage.

**SHOVE (Main Action)**: Roll to hit. On success, no damage but roll an opposed Str/Punch or Str/Exert check. On success, the attacker chooses whether the opponent falls prone or is knocked back 10'.

**SHATTER A SHIELD (Main Action)**: Requires an axe, mace, Foci-improved unarmed attack… Roll to hit. Success = no damage, but roll an opposed Str/Stab check (+1 to defender). Success = shield breaks. Magic shields are immune. Craft-0 & 1 scene to repair.

**GRAPPLE A FOE (Main Action)**:

- Roll to hit w/ Punch. On success, no damage, but roll an opposed Str/Punch check. On success the target is grappled.
- While grappled, neither attackers or defender can move from their spot, nor can they fight w/ anything but unarmed attacks.
- To escape a grapple: defender uses Main Action & rolls 1 opposed Str/Punch check & compares it vs each grappling attacker.
- At the end of each Round the defender remains grappled they take damage as if hit w/ a Punch attack from each grappling foe.
- If a target is larger than the attacker: attacker suffers -2 to the Grapple Check, or -4 for creatures barely plausible to Grapple.
- To move a grappled foe: attacker spends Main Action & rolls an opposed Str/Punch check. Success = target is moved 10' along w/ them, or thrown 5' & knocked prone. Failure = Defender breaks free.

**FIGHTING WITHDRAWAL (Main Action)**: Disengage from foes w/in melee range, preventing free attacks. You still must Move.

**CHARGE (Main & Move Action)**: Requires min of 10' to build momentum. Move x2 normal Movement Speed in a straight line before making a melee or thrown attack @ +2 to hit. After the attack, the attacker suffers -2 to AC for the rest of the Round.

**RUN (Move Action)**: Move normal combat movement, typically 30'. ½ speed to crawl, climb, swim, difficult terrain…

**SCREEN AN ALLY (Move Action)**:

- PC selects an ally w/in 10' to Screen until the PC's next turn.
- While screened, ranged/melee attackers attempting to hit the screened target must succeed an opposed Str or Dex Check using the combat Skill of their weapon vs the screener's weapon Skill. On failure, the attack roll is directed towards the screening PC.
- A PC can screen a # of attackers = to their Combat Skill. A PC w/ < Skill+1 can't effectively screen.

**SNAP ATTACK (Instant Action)**: attack outside of your turn. -4 to hit & uses your Main Action for the turn. GM resolves order of multiple snap attacks. Snap attacks are typically reserved for PCs or powerful combatants (No Name = No Snap attacks).

**TOTAL DEFENSE (Instant Action)**: Costs Main Action for the Round & can't be used if their Main Action was already used that Round. Avoids all Shock damage & PC gains a +2 bonus to AC until their next turn. CAN prevent Shock from Swarm attack.

**RELOAD A weapon (Main Action/Move Action/On Turn)**:

- Reload a weapon like a crossbow w/ the Slow Reload property (Main Action).
- Reload a weapon like a bow w/ the Reload property untrained or w/o a quiver readied (Move Action).
- Reload a weapon like a bow w/ the Reload property w/ Shoot+1 & a readied quiver (On Turn Action).

**DROP AN ITEM (Instant Action)**: Drop an item to free up your hands.

**PICK UP AN ITEM (Move Action)**: Grab an object w/ a free hand. Picked up objects are considered "Readied."

**GO PRONE (On Turn Action)**: Fall flat, forcing distant ranged attackers to take -2 penalty to hit. Adjacent foes gain +2 to hit

**STAND (Move Action)**: Gets up from the prone position, gathering any dropped belongings as part of the Action.

**DELAY AN ACTION (On Turn)**: Delay remainder of your Actions this turn until AFTER a specified target has acted.

**HOLD AN ACTION (Move Action)**: Hold remainder of your Actions until later in the Round, activating them as an Instant Action.

**EXECUTION ATTACKS (Main Action)**:

- Requires a target oblivious of danger, 1 min of setup time, & a weapon unless the attacker has a Foci or ability stating otherwise.
- A target's AC is irrelevant assuming the attacker's weapon is capable of harming them.
- Ranged attacks require a Dex/Shoot Skill check. Point Blank: DC6. Normal Range: DC8. Extreme Range: DC10. Melee always hits.
- A Warrior can use their Veteran's Luck ability, but only to reroll a failed check.
- If hit, the target makes a Physical Saving Throw @ a penalty = to the attacker's relevant Skill. Fail = Mortally Wounded (or unconscious if PC uses a non-lethal weapon & chooses so). Success = Target still suffers Max damage.
- Attacking unconscious or incapacitated targets always leaves them Mortally Wounded.
