**CLASS ABILITIES**:

- After Creation, instead of Foci raising Skills by tiers, Foci grant 3 Skill Points towards future purchase of the Skills next tier.
- After Creation, Foci can raise Skills past PC Level Caps. Skill+4 Max. @ Skill+4 choose another Skill to apply Points towards.
- A Warrior Foci is any the GM deems. An Expert Foci is any the GM deems.

**ALERT**:

**Level 1**: Gain Notice. Can't be surprised. Immune to Execution attacks. Roll w/ Advantage for Initiative.

**Level 2**: You always act 1st in the combat Round unless another also has Alert.

**ARMORED MAGIC**:

**Level 1**: You can use spells or arts while wearing armor whose Encumbrance is ≤ 2. You can use a shield while casting, provided your other hand is empty for gesturing.

**Level 2**: You can cast spells while wearing armor of any Encumbrance. You can cast w/ both hands full, but not bound.

**ARMSMASTER**:

(Not applicable to unarmed or non-thrown weapons. Doesn't stack w/ other Foci that add a Skills level to damage or Shock.)

**Level 1**: Gain Stab. Ready a Stowed melee or thrown weapon as an Instant Action. Add your Stab Skill level to a melee or thrown weapon's damage roll or Shock damage (assuming it has any).

**Level 2**: Shock from your melee attacks always treats the target as AC 10. +1 bonus to hit w/ all thrown or melee attacks.

**ARTISAN**:

Create Mods even if you are not an Expert.

**Level 1**: Gain Craft. Your Craft Skill is treated as 1 level higher (max of +5) for purposes of crafting & maintaining Mods. Mods you build require 1 fewer unit of arcane salvage (min of 1). Craft any profession's work w/o penalty.

**Level 2**: 1st Mod added to item requires no Maintenance & ½ the typical silver cost (this benefit stacks w/ masterwork 1st Mod benefit). You auto succeed to build masterwork gear, & 1/month you can reduce a created Mod's salvage cost by 1 further unit (min of 0).

**ASSASSIN**:

**Level 1**: Gain Sneak. Conceal an object no larger than a knife from anything less than a strip search. Draw this object as an On Turn Action, & your point-blank thrown or melee attacks made during a surprise Round w/ it can't miss.

**Level 2**: You can take a Move Action the same Round you make an Execution attack. You may split the Movement when making an Execution attack to before & after the attack. This movement is too quick to alert a victim or be hindered by guards.

**AUTHORITY**:

**Level 1**: Gain Lead. 1/day make a request of an NPC who is not openly hostile to you, rolling a Cha/Lead Skill check @ a DC = to the NPC's Morale score. On success they will comply, provided the request is not very harmful or highly uncharacteristic.

**BERSERKER (CUPOFCOFFE HB)**:

(Only Warriors or Partial Warriors can take this Focus.)

**Level 1**: 1/Combat, you may enter a fury as a Move Action, & end it as an On Turn Action. While in the fury you can choose to make your attack & damage rolls w/advantage, however until the start of your next turn, foes roll attack & damage w/ advantage against you. You are immune to mental effects that would alter your emotions while in the fury.

**Level 2**: When dropped to 0 HP for the 1st time in the fury, you may continue to fight for a # of Rounds = to either Stab or Punch before falling Mortally Wounded. Additional damage taken during this time (shy of catastrophic) can't stop or kill you. If healed during this time, you stabilize, but the ability's benefits end.

**CLOSE COMBATANT**:

**Level 1**: Gain any combat Skill. You can use knife-sized thrown weapons in melee w/o suffering penalties for the proximity of melee attackers. You ignore Shock damage from melee assailants, even if you're unarmored @ the time (invoking this benefit disrupts any spellcasting you might do that Round due to the need for violently active evasion). (Still susceptible to Shock from Swarm attacks)

**Level 2**: The Shock damage from your melee attacks treats all targets as if they were AC 10. The Fighting withdrawal combat Act is treated as an On Turn Action for you & can be performed freely.

**CONNECTED**:

**Level 1**: Gain Connect. If you've spent ≥ a week in a not-entirely-hostile location, you'll have built a web of contacts willing to do favors for you that are ≤ mildly illegal. You can call on 1 favor per game day & the GM decides how far they'll go for you.

**Level 2**: 1/session, if not entirely implausible, you meet someone you know who is willing to do modest favors for you. You can decide when & where to meet this person, but the GM decides who they are & what they can do for you.

**CULTURED**:

**Level 1**: Gain Connect. You fluently speak all the common languages of your native region & convey basic information in uncommon ones. You can learn a new language w/ a wk's practice w/ a native speaker. 1/day your polished ways automatically gain a minor favor from a non-hostile NPC, so long as it would not cost them significant expense or risk.

**Level 2**: 1/session, reroll a failed social Skill check.

**DANGER SENSE**:

(Experts/Partial Experts only. Only 1 foci such as this may be taken by any single PC. Effects are non-magical.)

**Level 1**: Gain Shoot. You can Ready a Stowed ranged weapon as an Instant Action. You may use a bow or two-handed ranged weapon even when a foe is w/in melee range, albeit @ a -4 hit penalty. You may add your Shoot Skill level to a ranged weapon's damage roll.

**DEALMAKER**:

**Level 1**: Gain Trade. W/ a ½hr of searching you can find a buyer or seller for any legal or illegal good or service available in the community. Finding rare services (king-slaying assassins, precious artifacts…) may require an adventure.

**Level 2**: 1/session, target a sentient who is not trying to kill you or your allies @ that moment. Make a request of it that it can comprehend. If plausible for it to agree to such terms it will do so for a price. The price for major favors may be dear.

**DEVELOPED ATTRIBUTE**:

(Can't be taken by Mages/Partial Mages)

**Level 1**: +1 to a chosen Attribute Mod (the Score does not change). The mod may increase again if later advancement improves the Score enough (max Mod bonus of +2). You can choose this Focus more than once to improve different Attributes. (HB)

**DIE HARD**:

**Level 1**: Gain +2 max HP per level. This bonus applies retroactively if you take this Focus after 1st level. You automatically stabilize if Mortally Wounded, provided your body is not destroyed.

**Level 2**: The 1st time each day that you are reduced to 0HP by an injury, you instead survive w/ 1 HP remaining. This ability can't save you from large-scale, instantly-lethal trauma.

**DIPLOMATIC GRACE**:

**Level 1**: Gain Convince. You speak all languages common to your region & can learn new ones to a workable level in a week or to fluency in a month. Reroll 1's on Skill check dice related to negotiation or diplomacy.

**Level 2**: 1/day silently consecrate a bargain. The deal's terms must be specific & time-limited, not open-ended. Breaking the deal requires a Mental Save unless it risks the target's life or something they value equally. Most NPCs won't attempt to break it.

**DUAL WIELDING (HB)**:

**Level 1**: Gain Stab. Two one-handed weapons can be carried Readied w/o costing Encumbrance. While dual-wielding, your AC increases by +1. 1/scene, you can use the Dual Feint Action (see below).

**Dual Feint**: Instant Action. When you miss an attack while dual-wielding, make another attack roll w/ either weapon w/ +2 to hit.

**FOLIE À DEUX**:

(Experts/Partial Experts only. Only one foci such as this may be taken by any single PC. Effects are non-magical.)

**Level 1**: Gain Convince. Your lies & deceptions register as true even by spells & abilities meant to perceive deception. 1/day, you can fully convince a listener of your sincerity. This belief lasts until circumstances or new evidence logically warrant doubt. However, once a target discovers a falsehood, they become immune to this ability.

**Level 2**: Gain a +1 bonus to your Charisma modifier (+2 Max). 1/day, you can deliver an outright lie; unless it is physically impossible or emotionally unbearable, the target must make a Mental save w/ a penalty = to your Convince skill or believe it for 1d4 rounds.

**GIFTED CHIRURGEON**:

**Level 1**: Gain Heal. 1/Round, as an On Turn Action, you may attempt to stabilize 1 Mortally Wounded adjacent target. When rolling Heal checks, roll 3d6 & drop the lowest die. You heal x2 as much HP as typical when healing after a battle.

**HENCHKEEPER**:

**Level 1**: Gain Lead. You may recruit Henchmen (HM), NPCs who require no compensation, roll Morale only if clearly betrayed, & will not be missed. HM will fight only to save their life, but will enter dungeons & risk danger for you. HM Stats = Peaceful Humans. Max # of HM = 1/3 your level ↑. You can dismiss & rehire HM amicably @ any time. More HM recruits are found w/in 24hrs of arriving in a community. You may have Hirelings in addition to your HM, but they behave normally.

**Level 2**: Your HM will fight for you against anything but clearly hopeless odds. HM stats = Veteran Soldiers. Skilled NPCs may become HM if you've done a service to earn their fierce loyalty.

**Level 1**: Base Armor Class = 14 + 1/2 your character level ↑.

**Level 1**: Gain Perform or Sneak. 1/scene, reroll attempt to maintain an imposture. You may make & flawlessly maintain 1 false identity of no great import. Only irrefutable proof can connect you w/ it. W/ a week's work you can alter this identity to a new one.

**Level 2**: You can alter your attire to allow you to swap between 3 chosen appearances as a Main Action. You can establish 2 additional false identities in each significant community you spend ≥ a day in.

**LUCKY**:

(Restricted to PCs w/ @ least 1 attribute mod of -1 or less).

**Level 1**: 1/wk you are unaffected by a blow that otherwise would have left you maimed, dead, or helpless. Roll x2 & take the better in games of chance.

**Level 1**: Gain Shoot. When making a Skill check for a ranged Execution attack or target shooting, roll 3d6 & drop the lowest die.

Only 1 such improvised trap can be maintained @ a time. More fearsome traps may be laid w/ congenial circumstances & the GM's permission.

**Level 2**: 1/scene, your efforts count as a Dispel magic spell against the trap or hazard, cast as if a Mage of x2 your level, w/ any relevant Skill check being Int/Notice or Dex/Notice. This ability can be used against any stationary magical effect that's susceptible to being dispelled by Dispel magic.

**WAR CASTER (ADAPTED FROM SWN DELUXE EDITION)**:

**Level 1**: When attacked while casting a spell, you may make a Phys Save at a penalty = to damage taken to avoid losing it. Even if your spell is interrupted, you do not lose the spell slot; only your Act is wasted though you can't cast another spell the next Round.

**Level 2**: Gain a +1 bonus to your Charisma modifier (+2 Max). 1/day, you can command a visible animal 1/scene, making it obey even complex orders that would usually be beyond its understanding, as long as they don't seem suicidal or overly dangerous to it. Magical beasts can attempt a Mental Save to resist your command.

**WRESTLER (CUPOFCOFFEE HB)**:

**Level 1**: Gain Exert or Punch. Roll 3d6 & drop the lowest die for Skill checks related to shoving & grappling. You ignore the size penalty for grappling & shoving significantly larger creatures, & may move grappled targets smaller than you w/o additional Actions or Checks.
