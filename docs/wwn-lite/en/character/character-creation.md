- After Creation, Foci can raise Skills past PC Level Caps. Skill+4 Max. @ Skill+4 choose another Skill to apply Points towards.
- A Warrior Foci is any the GM deems. An Expert Foci is any the GM deems.

#### ALERT
**Level 1**: Gain Notice. Can't be surprised. Immune to Execution attacks. Roll w/ Advantage for Initiative.

**Level 2**: You always act 1st in the combat Round unless another also has Alert.

#### ARMORED MAGIC

**Level 2**: You can cast spells while wearing armor of any Encumbrance. You can cast w/ both hands full, but not bound.

#### ARMSMASTER
(Not applicable to unarmed or non-thrown weapons. Doesn't stack w/ other Foci that add a Skills level to damage or Shock.)

**Level 1**: Gain Stab. Ready a Stowed melee or thrown weapon as an Instant Action. Add your Stab Skill level to a melee or thrown weapon's damage roll or Shock damage (assuming it has any).

**Level 2**: Shock from your melee attacks always treats the target as AC 10. +1 bonus to hit w/ all thrown or melee attacks.

#### ARTISAN
Create Mods even if you are not an Expert.

**Level 1**: Gain Craft. Your Craft Skill is treated as 1 level higher (max of +5) for purposes of crafting & maintaining Mods. Mods you build require 1 fewer unit of arcane salvage (min of 1). Craft any profession's work w/o penalty.

**Level 2**: 1st Mod added to item requires no Maintenance & ½ the typical silver cost (this benefit stacks w/ masterwork 1st Mod benefit). You auto succeed to build masterwork gear, & 1/month you can reduce a created Mod's salvage cost by 1 further unit (min of 0).

#### ASSASSIN
**Level 1**: Gain Sneak. Conceal an object no larger than a knife from anything less than a strip search. Draw this object as an On Turn Action, & your point-blank thrown or melee attacks made during a surprise Round w/ it can't miss.

**Level 2**: You can take a Move Action the same Round you make an Execution attack. You may split the Movement when making an Execution attack to before & after the attack. This movement is too quick to alert a victim or be hindered by guards.

#### AUTHORITY
**Level 1**: Gain Lead. 1/day make a request of an NPC who is not openly hostile to you, rolling a Cha/Lead Skill check @ a DC = to the NPC's Morale score. On success they will comply, provided the request is not very harmful or highly uncharacteristic.

You are immune to mental effects that would alter your emotions while in the fury.

**Level 2**: When dropped to 0 HP for the 1st time in the fury, you may continue to fight for a # of Rounds = to either Stab or Punch before falling Mortally Wounded. Additional damage taken during this time (shy of catastrophic) can't stop or kill you. If healed during this time, you stabilize, but the ability's benefits end.

#### CLOSE COMBATANT
**Level 1**: Gain any combat Skill. You can use knife-sized thrown weapons in melee w/o suffering penalties for the proximity of melee attackers. You ignore Shock damage from melee assailants, even if you're unarmored @ the time (invoking this benefit disrupts any spellcasting you might do that Round due to the need for violently active evasion). (Still susceptible to Shock from Swarm attacks)

**Level 2**: The Shock damage from your melee attacks treats all targets as if they were AC 10. The Fighting withdrawal combat Act is treated as an On Turn Action for you & can be performed freely.

**Level 2**: 1/session, if not entirely implausible, you meet someone you know who is willing to do modest favors for you. You can decide when & where to meet this person, but the GM decides who they are & what they can do for you.

#### CULTURED
**Level 1**: Gain Connect. You fluently speak all the common languages of your native region & convey basic information in uncommon ones.

#### DANGER SENSE
(Experts/Partial Experts only. Only 1 foci such as this may be taken by any single PC. Effects are non-magical.)

#### DEALMAKER
**Level 1**: Gain Trade. W/ a ½hr of searching you can find a buyer or seller for any legal or illegal good or service available in the community. Finding rare services (king-slaying assassins, precious artifacts…) may require an adventure.

**Level 2**: 1/session, target a sentient who is not trying to kill you or your allies @ that moment. Make a request of it that it can comprehend. If plausible for it to agree to such terms it will do so for a price. The price for major favors may be dear.

#### DEVELOPED ATTRIBUTE
(Can't be taken by Mages/Partial Mages)

**Level 1**: +1 to a chosen Attribute Mod (the Score does not change). The mod may increase again if later advancement improves the Score enough (max Mod bonus of +2). You can choose this Focus more than once to improve different Attributes. (HB)

#### DIE HARD
**Level 1**: Gain +2 max HP per level. This bonus applies retroactively if you take this Focus after 1st level. You automatically stabilize if Mortally Wounded, provided your body is not destroyed.

#### FOLIE À DEUX

**Level 1**: Gain Convince. Your lies & deceptions register as true even by spells & abilities meant to perceive deception. 1/day, you can fully convince a listener of your sincerity.

**Level 2**: Gain a +1 bonus to your Charisma modifier (+2 Max). 1/day, you can deliver an outright lie; unless it is physically impossible or emotionally unbearable, the target must make a Mental save w/ a penalty = to your Convince skill or believe it for 1d4 rounds.

#### GIFTED CHIRURGEON
**Level 1**: Gain Heal. 1/Round, as an On Turn Action, you may attempt to stabilize 1 Mortally Wounded adjacent target. When rolling Heal checks, roll 3d6 & drop the lowest die. You heal x2 as much HP as typical when healing after a battle.

Target must be able to understand the caster's wishes, but will obey to the best of its ability. Target makes a Mental saving throw to resist even suicidal actions. Caster's thrall limit = Caster level x 2. If this # is exceeded, the earliest thrall is freed 1st. Thralls display small tics that can provoke confusion & will give away the mental influence to an onlooker w/ ≥ Magic-0 who can observe them for ≥ 1 hr.

**SWAPPING SIGIL LEVEL 4**: Lasts 1 day. Range: W/in 1 mi of each other. Paired sigils count as 1 spell slot. The 1st casting inscribes a palm-sized radiant seal. The 2nd casting switches all creatures & objects w/in 10' of the caster w/ all creatures & objects w/in 10' of the 1st sigil. The caster can choose which targets switch. Objects too heavy or affixed do not swap. Unwilling targets w/ > 4HD make a Mental Save to resist.

**WARPGATE LEVEL 4**: Lasts 1 Round x Caster level or until dropped (Instant Action). Range: 100' x level. The caster opens a short-ranged spatial rift between 2 points, provided they can see or have physically occupied both points @ some prior time & provided the 2 points are ≥ 20' apart. The rift forms a gateway that connects the 2 points (large enough to drive a cart through) & allows subjects on either side to see & pass through the gate. Environmental qualities such as liquids or atmospheres will not pass through the portal; only intentionally-directed creatures & objects. Once the creature has passed through a portal, it can't pass through again until its next turn. Creatures partially in a rift when it closes are spat out on the far side.

**CONTROL WIND LEVEL 4**: AoE:a line 100' long & 30' wide. Caster conjures a fierce gust of wind. All creatures ≤ man-size make a Phys Save or are bowled over & blown 30', losing their next Round's Main Action & taking 1d6 damage. Light wooden structures & the like are knocked down. Optionally: Lasts 1 hr x Caster level. AoE: 1/4 mile around the caster. If used outdoors, the spell can alter the weather to any climate found normally @ that location @ any point during the year. The spell can't summon extreme weather, but can call rain & conventional storms sufficient to cause flooding in areas prone to it.

**TIME STOP LEVEL 5**: Lasts 1d4+1 Rounds. Affects the caster & up to 1 visible ally x Caster level. Targets briefly step outside of time, & the rest of the world freezes around them. They can't physically affect the world or move any object they were not carrying when they cast the spell. Any spells the caster or other allies cast can affect only their own group, & not those entities still in the normal flow of time.

**LABYRINTH BANISHMENT LEVEL 5**: Lasts Until dropped, or Caster or Target's death (Mental Save = Reappear next Round). Range: Visible point w/in 300'. Affects all creatures except the caster w/in a 10' radius of the target. Creatures are sent to an endless, lightless, empty extra dimensional maze. Failed Saves may be reattempted in 1 hr.

**BEHOLDER'S GAZE LEVEL 5**: AoE: Cone 100' long & 100' wide @ the end. Those caught in w/in the AoE of the spell must make a Phys Save. Anye who fail roll 1d6. 1.Unharmed. 2.Collapse & turn to dust. 3.Fall unconscious for 1 hr. 4.Go violently insane for 1hr & attack all around them. 5.Turn to stone. 6.Become enthralled to the caster's commands for 1 hr (see the Ineluctable Shackles of Volition (Dominate Person) spell).

**TYPHOON LEVEL 5**: Range: 3000'. AoE: 200' radius x Caster level (reducible to 20'). Requires a visible point. The caster unleashes a consuming destruction inflicting 1d8 damage x Caster level (Phys Save for ½), auto killing all targets w/ ≤ 4 HD. Destroys anything ≤ lightly-built stone structures & seriously damage's even fortifications. The caster can't be selective about targets w/in that area. This spell can't be cast indoors, & is hazardous to the caster. Caster makes a Mental Save on casting or suffers 1⁄4 of the damage inflicted ↑.

**MOLD LANDSCAPE LEVEL 5**: Range: 300' x Caster level. The caster may psychically mold the terrain over the course of 1 hr, provided the material can maintain shape. Tunnels & caves may be shaped ≤ 50' down, & hills raised ≤ 200' above grade. This spell can't work w/in a 1000' of stone or earth that has been significantly worked by intelligent creatures (excluding previous uses of the spell by the caster).

**IMPENETRABLE DOME LEVEL 5**: Lasts Until dispelled or the caster exits. Instant Action. Creates a transparent bubble of force around the caster (≤ 20' radius) that can't be penetrated from outside. The interior is warm, breathable, safe regardless of the exterior. Those w/in the bubble may leave but can't return. Objects, attacks, & magical effects (other than dispel) can't harm it or pass through it from either direction.

**DIMENSION PORTAL LEVEL 5**: Lasts 1 min x Caster level or until the caster passes through. Requires 1 hr. Range: 100 mi x Caster level. Caster opens a one-way portal large enough for a wagon from their location to a preset point.

### Druids & Beasts

Many Druid arts & spells refer to "beasts" as being valid targets. For the purposes of these abilities, a "beast" is any animal, magical beast, or monstrous plant creature that has < human intelligence. Druids can target any such creatures, but if they have more hit dice or levels than the Druid, they gain a +4 bonus on any saves a power may grant.

### Arts of the Druid

Scene: Returned after 1 Scene. Indefinite: Returned once Art is instantly "turned off." Day: Returned after 1 Night's Rest.

**Arboreal Agility**: You can climb trees, vines, or any slope w/ vegetation as easily as walking on flat ground. Effort: Day. On Turn action. Lasts 1 scene. You can also scale sheer walls or other non-vegetated surfaces.

**Beast's Eyes**: Effort: Indefinite. On Turn action. You can see normally in any lighting conditions except absolute darkness.

**Breath of Decay**: Effort: Scene. Main Action. Range: Melee. Exhale a burst of fungal spores upon dead tissue ≤ a corpse-size to reduce it to dust w/in seconds. 2d6 + your level vs undead. Also, you can consume organic matter as food w/out risk of poisoning or illness.

**Lash of the Wild**: Effort: Scene. Main Action. Target a beast w/in 100'. They must make a Mental save or become wild & untamed for 1 scene, acting solely on natural instincts, & disregarding any commands from riders or trainers.

**Savage Attack**: Effort: Scene (or Day if used more than 1/Scene). On Turn action. Your next attack that turn gains a hit bonus equal to your level, along w/ a damage & Shock bonus equal to half your level (rounded up). You may use Survive as your combat skill for the attack. This ability can only enhance a given attack once.

**Touch of Solace**: Effort: Day. Main Action. Range: Touch. The target recovers 1d6 HP + your level. If targeting a beast, the healing is 2x.

**Verdant Law**: Beasts instinctively perceive you as inedible & not prey.

**Wild Endurance**: Effort: Day. Main Action. Until dawn, you are immune to natural temperature extremes & can derive sustenance & sufficient water from any plant matter.

### Druid Spells

**DELUDE BEAST LEVEL 1**: Targets up to 1d6 beasts + 1 per caster level. Range: 100'. Duration: While the caster is present & 1 hour after departed. Beasts already in combat or in fear for their lives are unaffected. Mental Save. Failure = their senses are under the control of the caster, who can make them see, smell, or hear what they wish. If a delusion would put them in physical danger the spell breaks. The caster cannot change the illusions once they've left the target's presence.

**ENTHRALL BEAST LEVEL 1**: Requires a visible beast w/in 100'. Mental Save. Failure = the beast becomes docile & obedient to the caster (obeys verbal orders w/ a human intellect so long as they are neither suicidal nor contrary to its nature). The beast will fight for the caster, provided the odds are not overwhelming. The caster can have a # of enthralled beasts = to their level or a total hit dice of beasts ≤ 2x the caster's level, whichever is fewer.

**SEASONAL GROWTH LEVEL 1**: Requires 1 hr to cast while the mage paces the boundaries of the area to be affected, ≤ 1 acre x caster level. Once cast, the plant life w/in the area gains ≤ 1 yr of growth. This gain is uniform & indiscriminate. One acre of a peasant crop will yield enough to feed 2 people for 1 year, or 3 if the field is carefully prepared beforehand. This spell can't be cast again w/in a 1 mi radius until next spring.

**SHAPE PLANTS LEVEL 1**: Bend & shape or destroy all living, non magical plant material w/in 1 contiguous 10' cube x caster level. Requires 5 min to shape, but destruction of matter is instant. If used against plant-based monsters, the spell does 1d10 damage x caster level (Physical Save for ½). Cutting through magically shaped barriers takes 5hp x caster level of damage to cut a man-sized hole, & requires weapons suitable for chopping wood. The plants can be shaped w/ enough precision to make crude tools that have no moving parts.

**WOOD WARD LEVEL1**: Requires 1 visible subject w/in 30' x caster level. Lasts 1 scene. Target becomes immune to non-magical wooden or wood-hafted weapons or implements, as well as plant-derived toxins, spores, or glues. This spell can cure poisonings or infestations.

**BEAST PELLET LEVEL 2**: Requires a dead, mostly-intact beast ≤ an ox & 1 week. Magical spores cover the corpse, causing it to shrink to a marble sized pellet. The caster may hurl the pellet w/in 30' as a Main Action, whereupon the beast will reappear fully intact, albeit undead. It obeys the caster's spoken commands w/ human intellect & suicidal devotion. The beast withers away to dust 1 hr after summoning. The caster may have no more pellets at once than their level, & each pellet they carry subtracts 1 point from their maximum System Strain.

**BEAST SHAPE LEVEL 2**: The caster may adopt the outward semblance of any normal beast or plant < an ox & > a mouse. They gain the movement rating of the beast & its ability to breathe water or endure natural temperature extremes, but the caster's other statistics, senses, or unarmed attacks are unchanged. Any worn or held equipment merges w/ the beast form & continues to confer its usual AC or weapon statistics; the caster cannot change gear or drop items until the spell ends. Lasts until dispelled, next dawn, or ended as an On Turn action.

**SICKLES OF BONE LEVEL 2**: Requires ≤ 1 willing target x caster level. Range 30'. Targets grow long, sharp claws of bone for 1 hr x caster level. Targets are capable of clawing 2 in/min through plant matter. These claws do not hinder the user's dexterity, but count as magical weapons (1d8 damage, Shock 2/15, attribute = Str or Dex). If the caster is the target, they may use Magic instead of Stab or Punch as the combat skill. If cast on a creature that already has claws, fangs, or other natural weapons (not including unarmed-trained humans) the creature gains a bonus to damage rolls & Shock equal to the caster's level.

**TRACE THE PATH LEVEL 2**: The caster must focus on the image of a person or a type of creature when casting this spell. The plant life around the mage immediately telepathically directs the caster in the direction of whatever creature last fit the description, provided the tracked target would be perceptible to human senses. The plant life continues to lead the caster for up to 1hr x level, though the spell ends at dusk or when the caster casts another spell.

**BEAST WARD LEVEL 3**: Caster must pace off an area ≤ 1 acre x level, or spend a Main Action indicating a straight line ≤ 40' long w/in 100'. Wild beasts will not cross into the warded area or pass the indicated line unless permitted by the caster. Creatures who somehow end up in the area will think of nothing but fleeing it. Area wards persist as long as the caster remains inside them. Line wards or abandoned areas cease to protect 1 hr x level afterwards. Beasts incapable of feeling fear are unaffected by this spell.

**FERAL BARGAIN LEVEL 3**: This spell does not function in combat, & must be cast on a beast w/in 50' of the caster. The spell immediately opens a telepathic link w/ the target, after which the caster must offer something that the beast would reasonably want in exchange for a service from the beast. Even a hostile creature will spend a few mins parlaying unless directly threatened, & will negotiate w/ a human level of intelligence. If the mage can offer a suitable price for the creature's cooperation, the bargain will be made & the creature will be bound to perform it w/ human intelligence if they are capable of doing it & it is not suicidally dangerous. If the caster fails to keep their end of the bargain under the same terms, however, they must make a Mental save to avoid immediate death from the psychic backlash.

**PLANT WALK LEVEL 3**: Requires a willing target w/in 30' touching a plant of a volume ≥ their body. Once cast, the spell's recipient disappears into the plant. As a Main Action, they can step out of any plant of similar or larger size w/in 100' x caster level. Optionally, they can instead cast their senses to such a target plant & observe their surroundings as if standing there. Lasts 15 min or ends when the subject steps out of a plant. Damage inflicted on a plant while the subject is hiding in it is done to them as well.

**FORCE BEAST SHAPE LEVEL 4**: Functions as Beast Shape but can target even an unwilling creature w/in 100' (Physical save negates). If the creature is of a level > the caster, it rolls its Save w/ Advantage. The shifted creature retains its own stats, but drops its possessions when it changes. Lasts until dispelled or ended. Each week spent as an animal they must succeed a Mental save or succumb to the beast's nature & forget their prior life forever, gaining the attributes of the natural animal. If killed in animal shape they remain an animal in death.

**HARMONIOUS PASSAGE LEVEL 4**: Affects the caster & up to 3 other visible allies x caster level. So long as the spell is maintained, those protected are immune to plant or animal derived toxins or spores & are considered inedible by beasts, who will ignore them unless greatly provoked. They leave no mundanely-perceptible trace of their passage over unpaved earth & are immune to inclement weather, provided the atmosphere is not outright unsurvivable. Lasts until dawn, or until a subject voluntarily harms a beast or large plant.

**CLAIM DOMAIN LEVEL 5**: Requires 5 hrs & a full moon. Once cast, all the land w/in 1 mi x caster level is accounted part of the caster's domain. W/in this space, beasts will obey them w/ human intelligence in any way not contrary to their nature. The caster may speak w/ animals & plants w/in this area as if they had human intellect. They will also become intuitively aware of the location of any groups > 24 people traveling or living together. This domain cannot overlap w/ a prior caster's domain, & it has no power w/in the walls or boundary markers of human settlements or cities. A caster may maintain only 1 domain at a time.

**REND STRUCTURE LEVEL 5**: Range 200'. Affects only non magical structures. Plantlife erupts from the surface of the structure, their roots ripping it apart w/in 6 secs. The spell can affect only 1 structure or wall segment at a time & destroy no more than a 100' cube of it. The caster has very fine control of the demolition & can destroy only selective smaller parts of a structure, or prevent the demolition from harming those in or around the building. If not so careful, anyone w/in the structure takes 10d6 damage (Evasion save for ½).

**SHAPE ELEMENT LEVEL 1**: Lasts 1 scene (permanently if the new shape is stable w/out the aid of magic).

The caster has basic control over the direction & interior features of the tunnel, & can form simple structures w/in it.

**CONTINUAL FLAME LEVEL 2**: Lasts Until dispelled, extinguished, or dropped. A flame no larger than the caster is made effectively eternal. It consumes no fuel, though it may be used to burn or heat other things, & it resists extinguishing save being buried or wholly immersed in water. The caster can temporarily extinguish it @ will. A # of such flames can be created = to the Caster level; beyond that, special ingredients & fuels are needed that cost 500 silver pieces per flame.

**PACT OF ELEMENTAL RESISTANCE LEVEL 2**: Lasts 1 scene. Requires a visible target.
