### Language
PCs speak their native language + the common language + a # of languages = to their Connect + Know Skills.

## Healing & Hazards

### Mortally Wounded
- PCs @ HP ≤ 0 are Mortally Wounded. They can cry out, crawl a short distance, or take a small action @ GM discretion. Mortally Wounded PCs die in 6 Rounds, or instantly if more damage is taken.
- NPCs die outright @ ≤ 0HP, or can be knocked unconscious should a Less Lethal weapon be used.

### Stabilizing
- Main Action. Int/Heal or Dex/Heal. DC8 + # of Rounds since the target was downed (+2DC w/o medical tools).
- Only 1 ally can attempt to stabilize a target per Round. Others can attempt to aid the check.
- Once stable the target recovers w/ 1 HP after 10 min rest. The PC can act normally thereafter, but gains the Frail condition.

### Frail
- Frail PCs regain 0HP from a Night's Rest nor do they lose Strain, & will die immediately if brought to 0HP again.
- The Frail condition is cured by 1 week of bed rest, or by magical healing. A physician can attempt to remove the Frail condition w/ an hour's work & a DC10 Skill check. They get only 1 chance to do so.

### First Aid
A creature can restore 1d6 + their Heal Skill HP to an ally (No Check required). Each application adds 1 Strain to the target, but can be repeated as often as Strain allows. A single 10 min turn or scene is sufficient to apply as much first aid as desired. First aid works on Frail PCs, but does not remove the Frail condition.

### Magical Healing
A creature healed w/ magic loses any Mortally Wounded or Frail qualities & can rise on their next turn.

### A Night's Rest & Natural Healing
Assuming proper food, water, protection from the elements, & sleep, creatures recover the following after a night's rest (Creatures that are Frail do not recover HP nor lose System Strain this way):

- Regain their level in HP
- Regain all spent Spell Slots
- Regain all spent Effort
- Lose 1 point of System Strain

### System Strain (Strain)
Max System Strain = Con Score.

- Strain is often caused by certain spells, poisons, privation, or healing. A target @ max Strain cannot benefit from anything that would increase their Strain above their max. Being forced above Max System Strain is lethal.
- A decent night's rest typically removes 1 point of Strain.

### Instant Death
Being reduced to ≤ 0HP by a heavy attack (boulders, cannonfire) = instant death.

### Poisons & Disease
Phys Save to avoid. Possible Effects: HP Loss, Hallucination, Increased Strain, Death, Debuff… Lingering maladies may require multiple Saves over time to remove. Failure = worsening effects or death.

### Falling
1d6 damage per 10' of fall. ½ if done in a controlled manner w/ a successful Exert Check (DC 7 + 1 per every 10').

### Suffocation
PCs act normally w/o air for 1 round x Con Score. NPCs last 10 Rounds. After, they lose 1HP x level per Round.

## Combat

### Initiative
1d8 + Dex or Int Mod. PCs roll individually vs Foe's group Initiative. Foes gain no bonus unless quick. PCs win ties.

### Hit Bonus
Class attack Bonus + Attribute Mod + Skill (-2 if Skill < 0) + Foci/Abilities/Magic/weapon Mods + Circumstance mods

### Hit Roll Circumstance Modifier
- Shoot or melee an adjacent prone foe: +2
- Shoot @ a distant prone foe: -2
- Melee attack while prone: -4
- Half Cover: -2
- Near-Complete Cover: -4
- Making a Snap attack: -4
- Shoot outside of first range increment: -2
- Thrown attack while being meleed: -4
- Shoot a bow while being meleed: N/A

### Damage Rolls
Weapon Damage Die + Attribute Mod + Foci + Abilities + Magic/weapon Mods

### Shock Damage
Weapon Shock Damage + Attribute Mod + Foci + Abilities + Magic/weapon Mods.

- When rolling an attack, the defender announces their AC so the roller knows if their Shock would apply.
- On a miss, a weapon inflicts Shock Damage if the target's AC is ≤ the Shock value of the weapon.
- A throwable weapon's Shock only applies to melee attacks.
- On a hit, the Damage can't be < the Shock Damage if the target would be susceptible to Shock Damage from the attack.

### Dual Wielding
- Requires Stab+1. +2 bonus to Damage (NOT Shock Damage). -1 To Hit. Choose which weapon hits. Unarmed can't dual-wield.
- Shields can be used for dual-wielding attacks, but grant no AC bonus or Shock protection until the wielder's next turn if used so.

### Mounted Combat
- Riders w/ < Ride-0 suffer -1 to hit. Longbows, rifles, & spells are unusable while riding.
- Mounts share their rider's Initiative, but have their own Main & Move Action, which they can split around their rider's actions.
- Mounting or dismounting requires a Move Action.
- Trained war-animals can attack, but ordinary riding beasts fight only in self-defense & require a Morale or Instinct check each Round or flee w/ their rider. A rider can force obedience w/ a Cha/Ride or Dex/Ride check made as a Move Action.
- A mount reduced to 0HP dumps its rider prone as it falls.

### Special Combat Maneuvers
Guidelines for adjudicating improvised combat actions.

- If the maneuver requires striking a foe w/ something, make it an attack roll to hit.
- If it requires manipulating an object around a foe, but not directly attacking him w/ it, let it be a Skill check or an opposed check.
- If it succeeds, damage caused should be ≥ the hero's usual weapon damage by +2 or +4 due to cleverness.
- If the effect is hindering rather than directly injurious, take away the foe's Main Action, or Move Action.
- Actions that could both hurt & hinder a foe may do lesser measures of both.

## Actions & Common Combat Actions

### Action Types
**MAIN ACTION**: attack, manipulate a device, apply first aid, casting a spell…

**MOVE ACTION**: Climb, swim, crawl, difficult terrain… = ½ distance. In combat movement must be spent all @ once.

**ON TURN ACTION**: Fall prone, speak, draw a Readied object… Limit is @ GM's discretion.

**INSTANT ACTION**: Fast, simple. Can be made outside an actor's turn. Multiple Instants resolve in order GM decides.

### Common Combat Actions

**MAKE AN ATTACK (Main Action)**: Melee a foe w/in range or shoot a foe w/ a Ranged attack using a Readied weapon.

**CAST A SPELL (Main Action)**: If the caster has taken damage that Round, drawn or sheathed an item w/ their casting hand, or been badly jostled they can't take this Action. If damage is taken while casting the spell fizzles & the spell slot is wasted.

**USE A SKILL (Main Action)**: Perform a Skill that can be done in 6 secs (stabilize a wounded ally, turn a crank…)

**READY/STOW AN ITEM (Main Action)**: Draw a weapon or item from a pack. Changes from Readied to Stowed, or vice versa.

**SWARM ATTACK (Main Action)**:

- Each willing attacker takes this Act, targeting a foe w/in range.
- Once the final attacker has acted, 1 of the assailants makes an immediate attack (+2 to hit & +1 to damage for each additional assailant. Max +6/+3). Damage can't exceed the max of their normal attack, & is not applied to Shock.
- Even on a miss, Shock from the attack always harms the target regardless of their AC, if they're using a shield, or they have a Foci immunity to Shock. Total Defense however can prevent this Shock damage.

**SHOVE (Main Action)**: Roll to hit. On success, no damage but roll an opposed Str/Punch or Str/Exert check. On success, the attacker chooses whether the opponent falls prone or is knocked back 10'.

**SHATTER A SHIELD (Main Action)**: Requires an axe, mace, Foci-improved unarmed attack… Roll to hit. Success = no damage, but roll an opposed Str/Stab check (+1 to defender). Success = shield breaks. Magic shields are immune. Craft-0 & 1 scene to repair.

**GRAPPLE A FOE (Main Action)**:

- Roll to hit w/ Punch. On success, no damage, but roll an opposed Str/Punch check. On success the target is grappled.
- While grappled, neither attackers or defender can move from their spot, nor can they fight w/ anything but unarmed attacks.
- To escape a grapple: defender uses Main Action & rolls 1 opposed Str/Punch check & compares it vs each grappling attacker.
- At the end of each Round the defender remains grappled they take damage as if hit w/ a Punch attack from each grappling foe.
- If a target is larger than the attacker: attacker suffers -2 to the Grapple Check, or -4 for creatures barely plausible to Grapple.
- To move a grappled foe: attacker spends Main Action & rolls an opposed Str/Punch check. Success = target is moved 10' along w/ them, or thrown 5' & knocked prone. Failure = Defender breaks free.

**FIGHTING WITHDRAWAL (Main Action)**: Disengage from foes w/in melee range, preventing free attacks. You still must Move.

**CHARGE (Main & Move Action)**: Requires min of 10' to build momentum. Move x2 normal Movement Speed in a straight line before making a melee or thrown attack @ +2 to hit. After the attack, the attacker suffers -2 to AC for the rest of the Round.

**RUN (Move Action)**: Move normal combat movement, typically 30'. ½ speed to crawl, climb, swim, difficult terrain…

**SCREEN AN ALLY (Move Action)**:

- PC selects an ally w/in 10' to Screen until the PC's next turn.
- While screened, ranged/melee attackers attempting to hit the screened target must succeed an opposed Str or Dex Check using the combat Skill of their weapon vs the screener's weapon Skill. On failure, the attack roll is directed towards the screening PC.
- A PC can screen a # of attackers = to their Combat Skill. A PC w/ < Skill+1 can't effectively screen.

**SNAP ATTACK (Instant Action)**: attack outside of your turn. -4 to hit & uses your Main Action for the turn. GM resolves order of multiple snap attacks. Snap attacks are typically reserved for PCs or powerful combatants (No Name = No Snap attacks).

**TOTAL DEFENSE (Instant Action)**: Costs Main Action for the Round & can't be used if their Main Action was already used that Round. Avoids all Shock damage & PC gains a +2 bonus to AC until their next turn. CAN prevent Shock from Swarm attack.

**RELOAD A weapon (Main Action/Move Action/On Turn)**:

- Reload a weapon like a crossbow w/ the Slow Reload property (Main Action).
- Reload a weapon like a bow w/ the Reload property untrained or w/o a quiver readied (Move Action).
- Reload a weapon like a bow w/ the Reload property w/ Shoot+1 & a readied quiver (On Turn Action).

**DROP AN ITEM (Instant Action)**: Drop an item to free up your hands.

**PICK UP AN ITEM (Move Action)**: Grab an object w/ a free hand. Picked up objects are considered "Readied."

**GO PRONE (On Turn Action)**: Fall flat, forcing distant ranged attackers to take -2 penalty to hit. Adjacent foes gain +2 to hit

**STAND (Move Action)**: Gets up from the prone position, gathering any dropped belongings as part of the Action.

**DELAY AN ACTION (On Turn)**: Delay remainder of your Actions this turn until AFTER a specified target has acted.

**HOLD AN ACTION (Move Action)**: Hold remainder of your Actions until later in the Round, activating them as an Instant Action.

**EXECUTION ATTACKS (Main Action)**:

- Requires a target oblivious of danger, 1 min of setup time, & a weapon unless the attacker has a Foci or ability stating otherwise.
- A target's AC is irrelevant assuming the attacker's weapon is capable of harming them.
- Ranged attacks require a Dex/Shoot Skill check. Point Blank: DC6. Normal Range: DC8. Extreme Range: DC10. Melee always hits.
- A Warrior can use their Veteran's Luck ability, but only to reroll a failed check.
- If hit, the target makes a Physical Saving Throw @ a penalty = to the attacker's relevant Skill. Fail = Mortally Wounded (or unconscious if PC uses a non-lethal weapon & chooses so). Success = Target still suffers Max damage.
- Attacking unconscious or incapacitated targets always leaves them Mortally Wounded.

*(HB) Wis can be used as the Attribute Modifier for aimed weapons.

### Weapon Traits

- **2H**: Two Handed. Ranged two-handed weapons can't be fired while a foe is w/in melee range.
- **AP**: Armor Piercing. Ignores creatures' mundane armor & shields for purposes of its hit rolls.
- **B**: Bash. If used as a weapon or in a dual-wielding attack, shields grant no AC or Shock protection until the wielder's next turn.
- **FX**: Fixed. Requires a fixed position & ≥ 5mins to entrench it.
- **L**: Long. Can attack foes from 10' (even through ally's space). Doesn't apply melee's typical threatening range until w/in 5'.
- **LL**: Less Lethal. Foes brought to zero HP can be left alive @ the wielder's discretion.
- **N**: Numerous. 5 of these count as 1 Readied item.
- **PM**: Precisely Murderous. Imposes -1 penalty to the Phys Saves during Execution attacks. x2 damage even on Success.
- **R**: Reload. Costs a Move Action to reload. If the user has ≥ Shoot+1, they can reload as an On Turn Action.
- **S**: Subtle. Easily hidden in ordinary clothing or concealed in jewelry.
- **SR**: Slow Reload. Takes a Main Action to reload.
- **SS**: Single Shot. Takes 10 Rounds to reload. Reloading attempt is spoiled if a foe melees the wielder.
- **T**: Throwable. Can be used in melee or thrown. Does not deal Shock if thrown. -4 to Hit if thrown while foe is in melee range.
- **U**: Untrained. Due to its simplicity of operation, a user w/ < 0 in the relevant Skill can use them @ no unskilled hit penalty.

## Delving

### Visibility
A visible target is one who can be seen, or whose exact location is known. If a PC is seen & dives into a 5' bush to hide, they are not immune to ranged attacks assuming their foes are intelligent enough to have object permanence, though the PC may receive a partial cover bonus if the GM is feeling benevolent.

### Lack of Visibility
Should a target become unable to be seen (invisibility spell, a completely opaque smoke screen, pitch darkness) they are unable to be targeted by ranged attacks, melee attacks against them suffer a -4 penalty, & sight based checks against them fail.

### Lights
Torches typically cast a 30' radius & burn for around 6 turns (1hr). Lanterns for 24 turns (4hrs) but burn dimmer & require an additional turn when performing sight based tasks such as searching a room.

### Searching
A PC describes what/how they are searching. If described appropriately they succeed. For items not found by initial description, have the PC w/ best Wis/Notice roll for the PCs. Other PCs can attempt to aid.

### Locks & Traps
DC8 Dex/Sneak or Int/Craft to disarm ≤ good trap/lock (requires 1 turn). If in haste, Main Action @ +2DC. The Dm will do their best to telegraph the danger of the area (bloodstains, dart-sized holes in walls, the smell of death). Players will decide how to proceed, or not, accordingly.

### Time
Rounds = 10 seconds (6 in a min). Dungeon Turns = 10 mins (6 in an hour). Travel turn = 4 Hours (6 in a day).

### Encumbrance (Є)
A PC's absolute Max carrying capacity: Readied items = to ½ Str Score ↓. Stowed items = to full Str Score. Small bulk goods can be bundled (3 counting as 1 item). Requires a Main Action to Ready, Stow, or Unbundle items.

### Dungeon Mapping
- Do not concern yourself w/ EXACT measurements. Mapping is an art, not a science.
- Dungeons are measured in rough 10' squares.
- Hallways are described up to the point of change. So a 30' hallway w/ a turn in the middle could be described as: "The 10' wide hallway runs East 10ft, branches South, & continues on East another 20' before ending at a door."
- Should a room be rectangular, it will be described first by its North-South run, & then its East-West run.
- If a room's shape is more complex, describe it clockwise by the length of its walls beginning & ending @ the point of entry, so a 50'x40' rectangular room could be described as "You enter from a door on the West wall. The West wall runs north 20', turns East & runs 40', turns South & runs 50', turns West & runs 40', then turns North & runs 30' back to where you stand."
- Doors, openings, or other such can be described using winds & half winds, so a 30'x30' square room w/ one door on the West wall, three doors on the North wall, & two doors evenly spaced on the East wall may be described as "There's a door to the West, one to the North Northwest, one to the North, one to the North Northeast, one to the East NorthEast, & one to the East Southeast."
- When in doubt, sketch it out & confirm w/ the GM.

### Encounter Likelihood
- Roll checks every 3 Turns for average dungeons, every 2 if defenses are astir, or every 4 if dormant.
- Hidden areas or concealed chambers unknown to the natives of the site require no check.

**Roll 1d6:**
1. Encounter
2. Signs of the next encounter
3. A resource is unexpectedly depleted
4. Shift (hazards, factions…)
5-6. Free turn

### Encounter Procedure
Roll 1d6 x 10' if distance is uncertain.

- Unless one party would reasonably notice the other & themselves go unnoticed (making noise, carrying light in the dark…) parties make an opposed Wis/Notice check. Winner notices the other party 1st & decides how to act (greet, flee, ambush…).
- If the NPCs' reaction to the party is uncertain, make a Reaction Roll (2d6 + Cha if a PC is in a position to greet the other party).
- The GM will use the fiction to make PCs @ least somewhat aware of the NPCs' disposition.
- If the encounter devolves into combat, roll Initiative (1d8+Dex). NPCs have no modifier unless especially quick. PCs win ties.

### Reaction Rolls
If a creature's disposition is uncertain, make a Reaction Roll (2d6 & consult the table). If a PC is in a position to greet the targets, add their Cha to the roll. GM will make clear the results through narrative.

**Roll 2d6:**
- 2: Max Hostile
- 3-5: Very Hostile
- 6-8: Predictably hostile, friendly, or indifferent
- 9-11: Very friendly
- 12+: Max friendly

*Potential Peaceful Encounter Reactions: NPCs ask for a bribe, back off, ask a favor, offer tribute, socialize…

### Ambushes & Surprise
- Surprise grants a party a full Round to act before Initiative is rolled.
- Stealth ambushes may provide the opportunity to commit an Execution attack if the targets meet the criteria.
- Bewildering ambushes based on a shocking surprise may provoke a Morale check in undisciplined targets (GM's discretion).

### Morale Checks
- If 2d6 > ML score the creature loses the will to fight. PCs do not make Morale checks.
- Foes may be forced to check morale when 1st faced w/ violence, a leader falls, if victory looks hopeless, if terrified…
- Fleeing combatants may drop burdens, beg for mercy, pray to their gods, offer bribes, make a strategic withdrawal…
- Once a side has failed their ML check they're unlikely to re-engage the same foes until the situation has shifted in their favor.

### Fleeing & Escape
If foes pursue (many don't), escapee w/ best Dex/Exert rolls vs fastest pursuer. Successful escapes take ~1 turn & leave escapees in safety. If escapees # < pursuers: +1. Good escape plan: +1. Group w/ slowest member: -2.

## Overland Travel & Wilderness Survival

### Travel Times
- PCs can travel 10hrs per day.
- **Hours spent to cross a hex:**
  - Road Hex: 2
  - Hills, Desert, Forest Hex: 3
  - Jungle, Mts, Swamp Hex: 4
  - Bad Weather or Terrain: 2x
- Exploring a 6mi hex for points of interest: ½ day (longer if the task is especially difficult).

### Wilderness Encounters
Roll checks once per day of travel & once per night of camping outdoors:

**Roll 1d6:**
1. Encounter
2. Signs of the next encounter
3. A resource is unexpectedly depleted
4. Shift (weather, hazards, etc…)
5-6. Free turn

### Wilderness Encounter Distance
Groups usually encounter each other @ max sight range barring concealment.

- Roll opposed Wis/Notice to determine who spots who 1st; the party who gains the edge can usually avoid the other group.

**Distance by terrain:**
- Dungeons, Alleyways, etc: 1d6 x 10'
- Forest, Hills, etc: 2d6 x 10'
- Mts, Deserts, Plains, Tundra, Sea: 4d6 x 10 Yds

### Hex Exploration, Privation & Supplies
The benefits from a Night's Rest may require fire & shelter if weather is poor.

**System Strain from privation:**
- Night w/o Adequate Shelter/Fire: +0 Strain
- 1st Day w/o Enough Food: +0 Strain
- 1st Day w/o Enough Water: +2 Strain
- Harsh Night w/o Shelter/Fire: +1 Strain
- Consecutive Day w/o Food: +1 Strain
- Consecutive Day w/o Water: +3 Strain

**Foraging:**
- PCs traveling in non-barren terrain or w/ a caravan or a well-stocked wagon need not worry for food, drink, or shelter.
- Foraging requires 1 hour. Successful Check = 1d6 Forage Units (FU) + the sum of the group's Survive Skills (max 10).
- Typical foraging: DC10
- Each Successive Day Foraging the Same Hex: -1DC
- Foraged food spoils in 3 days. Preserving it requires 1 Watch & 1 Forage Unit of firewood.
- 1 Forage Unit = 1 day's food for 1 person (1Є or ½ Bundled), 1 day's water for 1 person (1Є), or 1 night's firewood (4Є).

### Porters
Porters are NonAdventuring hirelings. Porter/2 Porters w/ Shared litter: 12Є/30Є

### Beasts of Burden
In non-arid terrain beasts need not worry for fodder or water, otherwise:

- 1 Day's Fodder/Water for a small beast (such as a Mule): 2Є/4Є.
- 1 Day's Fodder/Water for a large beast (such as a Horse): 4Є/8Є.
- A beast's Є capacity: Riding Horse/& Laden Rider: 20Є/5Є. Mule/Heavy Pack Horse: 15Є/30Є.
- A Beast can be butchered into a # of day's rations = to its Є capacity.

## Sea Travel

### Travel & Provisions
- Ships can sail 24hrs/day if far from coasts & other peril. Ships move ½ speed in unfavorable weather & stall w/0 wind.
- **Provisions:** Food(250 person-days) 500$p, 1t. Water(50 person-days) 0$p, 1t. Repair Supplies (15HP) 200$p, 1t.
- Calamity or privation may force a crew morale check. Failures can eventually result in mutiny if not quelled.

### Crew
**Cost by month / Crew Strength:**
- Sailor: 50$p / 1
- Officer: 250$p / x2 (reqs 10 troops)
- Captain: 250$p / x5 (reqs 100 troops)

**Crew considerations:**
- Expeditions w/o prospects of riches might find crew @ x5 to x10 the usual pay rate, but few sailors will risk their lives for less.
- Crews of ships commissioned for privateering, piracy, or expeditions into the unknown typically demand shares of the profit.
- Ship's owner: ½ of profit & magic items. The 2nd ½ split in shares: Capt = 5, officer = 2, & sailor = 1. (Pirates split haul evenly).
- Common sailors don't require extra incentive for ordinary peril (minor sea monsters, magical storms, pirate assault…).

### Ships & Expenses
- Every 3 months ships require 1 week in port for maintenance & repairs (5% of ship, weapons, etc… total cost).
- Repair costs: Missing HP x 5$p. Best Craft Skill + best Sail Skill = Max HP restorable per day.
- Ship upgrades cost a % of the ship's total cost & increase a ship's stat by the same percentage (typically between 5% to 20%).

### Ships

| SHIP | COST | CREW | HEXES/DAY | GRACE | HP | AC | CARGO | WPNS | SIZE |

- Such brawls can be run as normal combat encounters w/ a few exceptions (see below) or as mass combats (see pg 15).
- Ships receive their own Turn in combat in which they can fire off 1 of their weapons provided they have the crew to do so. Once a ship's weapon is fired, it's assumed the weapon's crew begins reloading unless they're unable to do so or take up another task.
- A ship also has a movement action they may use to try to gain an advantage vs their foe, gaining a bonus to their attack, dam, or AC.

### Crafting Gear
Crafting Equipment = Costs ½ the item's retail value. Typically requires Craft Skill check.

**Difficulty:**
- Background Item: No Skill check
- Item unrelated to Background: DC7
- Demanding item: DC9
- Specialist item: DC11

**Crafting Time:**
- Torches, Spears, Cloaks, etc: 1Hr
- Clothes, Blunt weapons, leather armor: 1Day
- Blades, Metal armor, Cart: 1wk

**Crafting bonuses:**
- A Craft-0 Assistant = x2 speed
- DC9 Int or Dex Craft check = x2 speed. On failure lose ½ material & gain no speed.

**Additional rules:**
- DC7 Int or Dex Craft check to jury rig something crude but plausible, DC10 check for something more difficult/less plausible.
- Masterwork gear costs x10 retail & x2 time to craft. DC10 Int or Dex Craft check @ end of crafting, on failure item is normal.
- Masterwork weapon: +1 Hit. Masterwork Armor: Normal armor -1Є (min of 1. Not for purposes of Armored Magic foci.)
- The 1st mod added to Masterwork items costs x2 as much in arcane salvage & supplementary costs, but requires no maintenance.

### Gear Modifications & Maintenance
- Adding Mods to gear requires Expert or Partial Expert, ≤ Craft+1, & rare "salvage" material. Takes 1 week x Mod's required level of Craft to install. ½ time w/ Craft-0 Assistant, or if all waking hours are spent working on the mod.
- Mods can Stack, but can't increase attack or damage bonus > +3 or Skill Check bonus > +1.
- Expert/Partial Expert can Maintain a # of Mods = Int + Con Modifiers + (3 x Craft Level). A modification requires maintenance every 24 hrs or it stops working (assumed to be done automatically by an expert/partial expert). If unmaintained for a 1 week item becomes unfit for use. After 1 yr it may become destroyed. Requires 1 hr of work to clean up a maintenance backlog.

### Mods

**Arrow Storm (Craft+2)**: A ranged weapon automatically generates its own ammunition. The conjured projectiles vanish after 1 Round. This mod does not increase reload speed. Cost: 1 Salvage & 5k $p.

**Assassin's Trinket (Craft+2)**: A one-handed weapon is modified to adopt the shape of some item of jewelry or adornment. It can be shifted to or from this shape by the owner as an On Turn Action. Cost: 1 Salvage & 1k $p.

**Augmented Gear (Craft+1)**: A tool, medical kit, or other item of equipment is improved for a specific purpose chosen at the time of augmentation. Skill checks made for that purpose gain a +1 bonus w/ the item. Cost: 1 Salvage & 5k $p.

**Customized (Craft+1)**: The weapon or suit of armor has been carefully tailored for a specific user. When used by them, they gain a +1 to hit w/ the weapon or +1 Armor Class w/ the armor. This mod doesn't work w/ shields. Cost: 1k $p.

## Alchemy

### Alchemy Basics
- Alchemy is a Skill restricted to Experts/Partial Experts. Others who take it gain only knowledge benefits.
- Concoctions created by alchemists are called Works & divided into Lesser & Greater.
- Making a Work requires ingredients, a formula, & a lab.
- Ingredients can be bought in town, looted from dungeons, or foraged in the wild (level x 10 $p of material for each day foraging).
- Formulae for listed works are common knowledge among alchemists. Others can be looted from tombs or bought @ shops.
- **Lesser lab**: Can be assembled w/in days, occupies ≥ an inn room's space, weighs 10Є packed, & can be packed/unpacked in 1hr.
- **Greater lab**: 5k $p to assemble, occupies 1 cottage's worth of space, is a cartload packed, & can be packed/unpacked in 1 day.

### Crafting Works
If the alchemist has a lab, formula, material, & time, they can attempt to craft a Work. Int/Craft check vs listed difficulty.

**On failure:** Alchemist chooses to accept the loss or push the reaction.
- **Accept the loss**: lose materials & time but nothing goes amiss.
- **Push the reaction**: Repeat the Skill check. Failure: Loss of time, material, & roll an Alchemical accident.

### Alchemical Accidents

**Roll 1d6:**
1. **Explosion**: 1d6 + DC dam, x2 for Greater Works. Lab destroyed.
2. **Fire**: 1d6 Dam, x2 for Greater Works. Lab useless for 1 wk.
3. **Poison**: Phys Save. Failure: Bedridden 1 wk. Success: +3 Strain.
4. **Stench**: Horrific odors render the lab unusable for 1 wk.
5. **Broken Tool**: That specific work can't be attempted again for 1 wk.
6. **Ordinary failure**: Only materials & time are lost.

### Using Alchemical Works
- Main Action. Range: 60'. If a Work requires direct application: attack vs AC. If thrown as a grenade: attack vs AC 12. On failure w/ grenade-like Works: Miss by 1d20 ft. 1d12 determines clock face direction of miss.
- Readied Work = 1Є. ≤4 Stowed Works = 1Є.
- Works w/ the same effect do not stack; only the strongest applies.
- Works are mundane & can't be detected, dispelled, resisted, or negated by anti-magical means.

### Lesser Works
These formulae are commonly known to Alchemists. The creation DC, materials cost, & time are listed.

**Acid Vial**: DC10. 50 $p. 1 day. Targeted. 1d4 damage. Physical or Mental Save. Failure = target loses their next Move Action from pain & panic. Can corrode tiny metal or wooden objects in about 15 mins.

**Binding Paste**: DC9. 50 $p. 1 day. The paste forms a rock hard bond between objects. Hardens in 1 Round, lasts for 1hr. The paste does not set if the objects are moving or flexing when applied.

**Blinding Dust**: DC9. 50 $p. 2 days. Targeted. Phys or Evasion Save. Failure: -4 to hit rolls & visual Skill checks for 1 scene. Creatures w/ ≥ 4HD make a Phys Save @ the end of their turns to end.

**Healing Salve**: DC7. 10 $p. 1 day. Regain 1.5x usual HP after a night's rest ↑. Frail creatures gain no benefit.

**Incandescent Dust**: DC9. 50 $p. 1 day. When thrown into a flame ≥ a torch it burns brilliantly for 1d6 Rounds illuminating everything w/in 50'. Anyone looking @ the fire makes a Phys Save or is dazzled for 1 Round (-4 penalty to hit rolls & AC).

**Inflammable Oil**: DC8. 100 $p. 1 day. A vial covers an object ≤ a large wood door. Cures w/in mins into a clear layer that ignites if struck. Flammable objects light on fire; non-flammable ones burn for 1 Round.

**Itching Dust**: DC9. 100 $p. 2 days. Targeted. Phys Save or suffer -2 to hit & AC for 1 scene. Creatures w/ ≥4HD make a Phys Save @ the end of their turns to ignore the itch for the rest of a fight.

**Luminescent Oil**: DC8. 50 $p. 1 day. A vial of this oil can cover 1 person or 10 torches. It causes an object to glow w/ a ghostly white light for 1hr barely sufficient to read by & adequate to make out the rough shapes of objects w/in 10'.

**Self-Igniting Oil**: DC8. 50 $p. 3 days. Thrown as a grenade. Creates a pool of flames, 5' in diameter, that burns for 2 Rounds. Those w/in it @ the start of their turn must move out or take 1d6 damage. It will ignite any flammable objects.

**Smoke Cloud**: DC9. 25 $p. 2 days. Thrown as a grenade that bursts into a cloud of smoke 10' in diameter. Lasts 1 Round. Ranged attacks through the smoke or melee attacks w/in it suffer -4 to hit, assuming attackers know roughly where their targets are.

**Soothing Powder**: DC8. 25 $p. 2 days. A drug that when consumed causes a helpless but very happy stupor for 1d6 hours. Phys Save to resist. Creatures w/ ≥4 HD make a Phys Save to throw off the effects when threatened.

**Touchstone**: DC10. 50 $p. 3 days. A prep'd alchemical kit w/ 1 use x alchemist's level. Can detect poisons & identify false precious metals or gems. Vs professional poisoners, the user makes an opposed Craft vs Heal Skill check in order to detect the toxin.

### Greater Works
These formulae are commonly known to Alchemists. Creation DC, materials cost, & time are listed.

**Aqueous Solvent**: DC11. 250 $p. 5 days. Unusable in combat; can melt through ≤ a fist-sized mass of metal/wood in < 1 min.

**Courage Elixir**: DC10. 200 $p. 1 wk. Potent analgesic. Adds 10 temp HP for 1 scene to the imbiber. The inability to feel pain leaves them unable to track their HP. At the scene's end, the phantom HP is lost & the user may end up Mortally Wounded.

**Infernal Wind**: DC11. 250 $p. 1 wk. Thrown as a grenade. Splatters in a 5' radius where it hits. Must be lit, then erupts into a cloud of black smoke. 1d6 damage to anyone in its area & creates a smoke cloud 10' in diameter. Ranged attacks through the smoke or melee attacks w/in it suffer -4 to hit, assuming attackers know roughly where targets are. Lasts for 1 Round x alchemist's level.

**Lethal Poison**: DC11. 500 $p. 1 wk. A small vial of clear, tasteless liquid strong enough to kill an ox w/in 1 min. Phys Save or take 1d6 damage x level of the alchemist. Damage takes effect 1d10 Rounds after consumption.

**Revivifying Draught**: DC10. 200 $p. 1 wk. Imbiber of this draught can exert themselves freely for 24hrs w/out need of rest. They physically can't sleep during this time. Draught adds 1 Strain. If used > 1/wk: Phys Save or suffer fatal heart attack.

**Sleeping Powders**: DC10. 200 $p. 3 days. Tasteless. When consumed causes intense drowsiness. If an imbiber feels threatened they can shake off the effects. If unawares: Phys Save @ penalty = to the Alchemist's Skill. Failure = fall asleep w/in 1 min.

**Sovereign Specific**: DC11. 200 $p. 1 wk. An imbiber suffering from poison can make a new save w/ a bonus = to the creator's Alchemy Skill. On a success, the poison's effects are negated. The specific must be used w/in 6 Rounds of the poisoning.

**Unquenchable Flame**: DC12. 1000 $p. 2 wks. This fist-sized mass is covered w/ a protective film. If scratched the mass will ignites & burn w/ a ferocious heat & toxic fumes for 1d6+4 Rounds. 1d6 damage to anyone who spends their full Round w/in 10'. The mass burns almost anything (stone, water, metal…) & often burns a hole 3' deep before consuming itself.

## Magic

### Arts & Effort
- Arts are fueled by Committing Effort. A PC's Class determines from whence Effort is based.
- Typically: Skill + Attribute Modifier + 1 (if Full Class) = Max Effort.
- **Committed Effort for the Scene** = Recharges after 1 Scene.
- **Committed Effort Indefinite** = Returned once you "turn off" an Art instantly.
- **Committed Effort for the Day** = Recharges after 1 Night's Rest.

### Preparing & Casting Spells
- A mage can prepare any spell from their spellbook after 1 night's rest. This takes approx 1hr.
- Spells typically require a Main Action, free hand, & vocalization as loud as conversation. Casting is obvious, but which spell isn't.
- Spells typically require line of sight w/ the target, unless line of sight would defeat the purpose of the spell (i.e. scrying, etc).
- Spells typically require a willing or helpless target, otherwise the target is allowed a Save to reduce or negate the effects.
- Spells typically last until dispelled by choice as an Instant action by the caster, or by force, such as the caster falling unconscious or dying, exceeding the spell's time limits, or exceeding its limitations (i.e. violent motion while invisible, etc).
- If a mage takes damage or is severely jostled they can't cast spells until their next turn. Damage does not interrupt Arts.
- Whether Spells or Arts can be cast while in armor will depend on the Class restrictions.
- The same spell may be cast > once if the mage has multiple castings left for the day.
- Partial Mages apply their full character level to any level-based effects from spells.

### Learning Spells
- Spellcasting full Mages begin w/ 4 1st level spells & Partial Mages w/ 2. Spells may be chosen from any spell list available to them.
- Some Mages gain new spells @ level up. High Mages pick 2 High Magic spells they are able to cast. Necromancers & Elementalists pick only 1, but can choose from High Magic spells or spells from their tradition. Partial Mages that are capable of casting spells learn spells just as full Mages do.
- Learning a spell from a grimoire = (1 week x Spell Level) - (1 week x Level of the Mage's Magic Skill). Min of 1 day.
- A PC must be capable of casting the spell to learn it.

### Grimoires
- Looted grimoires contain a # of spells to learn = to the level of its initial owner (assumed to be highest level spell's required casting level).
- To select spells, pick a 1st level spell, then continue picking spells successively until reaching the highest level spell the original owner could cast. Start over @ level 1 spells & continue like this until a # of spells have been chosen = to the original Mage's level.
- Some grimoires contain curses, & some spells contain flaws.

### Developing New Spells
- Int/Magic check = DC10 + Spell's Level. Magic-0 Apprentice: +1 bonus. Mage researching New Magic of their specialty: +1 bonus.
- On success the spell is created. On failure the initial time & money is lost & PCs must roll on the Formula Flaw table.
- PCs decide to quit or continue w/ the flawed spell, spending ½ the original time, no additional coin, & gaining a +1 bonus.
- PCs can repeat this process adding flaws & paying ½ the original time until successful or until they abandon the project.

**Spell design guidelines:**
- Spells should not substitute for other classes.
- Spells should not offer simple numeric bonuses.
- Spells should not offer cheap & easy combat damage.
- Spells that buff a target shouldn't last > a scene.
- Spells should not create permanent magical effects or valuable matter.
- Spells should not be petty.

### Spell Development Costs

| SPELL LEVEL | LAB FEE | MATERIAL FEE* | TIME COST |
|-------------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Level 1 | 50k $p | 25k $p | 1 month |
| Level 2 | 125k $p | 50k $p | 2 months |
| Level 3 | 250k $p | 100k $p | 4 months |
| Level 4 | 500k $p | 200k $p | 8 months |
| Level 5 | 1m $p | 400k $p | 2 years |

*x2 Material Fee = ½ Time

### Formula Flaws

**Roll 1d10:**
1. The spell can only target the caster.
2. The spell only works on willing targets.
3. The formula is unchanged, but you gain no cumulative +1 bonus on the research roll for this or prior research continuations.
4. The spell can only target people other than the caster.
5. The spell is slow & requires a Main Action to cast (2 Main Actions over 2 successive Rounds if it already required a Main Action).
6. The spell is very draining, exhausting 2 spells worth of energy for the day instead of 1.
7. The spell inflicts 1d4 Strain when cast. If this maxes their Strain they fall unconscious for 10 min.
8. The spell is 1 level > expected (does not increase research costs or time). The project fails if unable to cast a spell of that level.
9. The spell is simply unreliable. When cast, roll 1d6. On a 1, the spell fizzles uselessly & the casting slot is wasted.
10. The whole attempt was a mistake. All progress & research materials are lost & everything must be done over from the start.

### Creating Magical Items
- Permanent magic items require ≥ 1 adventure to acquire the required components.
- Int/Magic Skill check to create. Success: Item is created. Failure: Initial time & money is lost. PCs roll for Item Flaw.
- PCs can quit or continue w/ the flawed item, spending ½ the original time, no additional coin, & receiving a +1 bonus.
- PCs can repeat this process adding flaws & paying ½ the original time until successful or they abandon the project.

### Magic Item Creation Costs

| TYPE OF MAGICAL ITEM | DC | Creation Cost | Creation Time |
|----------------------|----|---------------|---------------|
| Single-use item | 8–10 | 250–2.5k $p | 1 week |
| Multi-use item w/ limited charges | 9–11 | 5k –25k $p | 1 month |
| Low-powered but permanent magic item | 10 | 12.5k $p | 1 month |
| Significant item w/ a situation changing effect | 12 | 50k $p | 3 months |
| Powerful item or one w/ multiple significant abilities | 14 | 250k $p | 6 months |

**Modifiers:**
- 2 doses of single use item: -1 penalty
- 4 doses of single use item: -2
- Magic-0 Apprentice: +1

### Calyxes
- A calyx is a magic effect trapped in an object for later use (scroll, tablet…) Mages can't learn spells from these.
- Any literate in the language of its inscription can decipher its content. If not, 1 day's study by someone w/ Magic-0 is required.
- A calyx holds ≥ 1 spell. Each spell can be cast once (unless duplicates are embedded in the same calyx) before it's destroyed.
- Spells are cast @ the level of the mage who inscribed them. Assume original Mage's level = highest level spell's required casting level.
- Using a calyx requires holding it & a Main Action. No vocalizations or gestures are needed. Calyxes are not restricted by armor or shield usage. If struck or jostled while casting the spell is wasted.
- A spellcaster can't use their own arts to boost a spell embedded in a calyx. It must be cast in its normal, unmodified form.
- User's Magic Skill must be ≥ the spell's level -1 to trigger it safely, otherwise Int/Magic or Cha/Magic Skill check is needed.
- DC = 8 + spell's level. Failure by ≤ 2: the spell is wasted. Failure by >2: its cast, but @ the wrong target or wrong effect.

- Rare. Possess their own intellect & will directed toward carrying out a task chosen by its creator.
- Sentient weapons have ≥ 1 additional special ability related to their purpose, chosen by the GM.
- Some can vocally or telepathically communicate w/ their bearer, though not all speak modern languages.
- Bearers who offend the weapon must make an appropriate Cha/Stab or Shoot Skill check against DC 8 + the weapon's magical bonus in order to force its obedience for the day. Failure = weapon is treated as non magical for the rest of the day.
- Weapons that have a now-impossible purpose may try to reinterpret their function as a pursuable task. Most will not demand constant cooperation. Bearers who do not aid, or work counter to its purpose, will likely be unable to wield it.

### Magic Weapons
- Magic weapon bonuses are added to attack rolls, Damage rolls, & Shock dam, but do not stack w/ Masterwork bonuses.
- Crafting Magical weapons requires a Mage & a Masterwork Item to Enchant. 3 Effects per item max.

**Adamantine**: Unbreakable by all conventional & most magical means.

**Augmented**: weapon's enchantment hit & damage bonus increase by +1 to a max of +4.

**Blighted**: Created to slaughter a specific type of creature. Rolls damage x2 & takes the better vs them.

**Bloodbound**: weapon & wielder form a symbiosis. While wielding the weapon they regen 1HP/hr as magical healing. Also allows a reroll of a failed Save 1/day.

**Bloodthirsty**: When the wielder reduces a foe to 0HP, they regain 1d8 + the creature's HD in lost HP (can't exceed max HP).

**Despairing**: weapon drains a victim's courage. By taking 1 Strain as an Instant Action when they hit a target, they can force the victim to make an immediate Morale check @ a -1 penalty. This effect can be applied to a target 1/scene.

**Energetic**: Covered in flames, ice… Minor enchantment: +2 damage. Major enchantment: +1d6+2 damage (not applied to Shock).

**Enervating**: Phys Save or they lose their next Move Action (can't affect a creature again until their next turn).

**Enraging**: On Turn Action to rage. Gain +2 to hit & damage, reroll failed Mental Saves, continue fighting 1 Round after falling to 0HP, & auto succeed Morale checks. Each round wielder must attack, move to attack, or spend their Main Action to end the rage.

**Forfending**: The 1st Screen Ally Check each Round auto succeeds. Screened allies are immune to Shock & gain +2AC.

**Fortifying**: The weapon can hold ≤ 3 Strain in place of its bearer. Its Strain decreases 1 point per night.

**Hunting**: Against non-sentient beasts, the weapon rolls damage x2 & takes the higher.

**Illuminating**: Casts 60' of light at the wielder's mental command. +1 Strain to make the light visible only to the bearer & their allies (lasts 1hr).

**Longarm**: A ranged weapon's effective range is doubled.

**Lucky**: As an Instant Action, 1/scene the wielder can call on their luck to reroll an attack roll, damage roll, or Skill check made during combat, & take the better. When used they roll 1d6 as well; on a 1, the attempted roll fails or rolls min damage instead.

**Merciful**: weapon never kills any target it reduces to 0HP; instead, they are immediately stabilized & will awaken 1hr later w/ 1HP. This weapon's damage is painless & leaves no visible marks.

**Negating**: When the bearer is targeted by magic, they may accept 1 point of Strain as an Instant Action & make a Phys Save. Success = they are unaffected. Save may only be attempted once per instance of effect.

**Nightwalking**: weapon allows the bearer to step through shadows, entering 1 & appearing in another ≤ 100' away as a Move Action. Even very small shadows will suffice, & 1 is generally available in any area not devoid of light or objects to cast them.

**Omened**: 1/day the weapon can provide a yes, no, or unclear answer to a single question asked by a wielder regarding events that could happen to them w/in 1hr. GM answers to the best of their ability, but players' actions may change the outcome.

**Penetrating**: This weapon ignores mundane armor, shields, beast hides… for purposes of determining Shock susceptibility.

**Phantom**: As an On Turn Action, the bearer can turn the weapon invisible & intangible to anyone but themselves or revert it to normal. While invisible, the weapon can harm only intangible or immaterial foes & can't be detected or touched by others.

**Phasing**: The weapon can be tuned to pass through solid obstacles @ will. Causing the weapon to phase is an On Turn Action that adds 1 point of Strain to the bearer. Until the end of the Round the weapon ignores any armor, cover, or barriers.

**Piercing**: This weapon inflicts Shock damage on anything attacked w/ it, even if a target is immune to Shock. However, the weapon never inflicts > its Shock damage. If the weapon doesn't normally do Shock, it gains a base Shock rating of 2/-.

**Rampaging**: Whenever this weapon kills a creature w/ ≤ 1HD, its bearer may immediately make another attack on a target w/in range. If no additional targets are available, the wielder instead gets an instant free Move Action.

**Rectifying**: damage to undead, robots, or synthetic life is rolled x2 & the better taken. It can affect insubstantial or otherwise immune entities of the types, & undead killed by it are permanently dead barring tremendous revivification or immortality.

**Returning**: If thrown, dropped, or disarmed, the weapon can be called back to the owner's hand as an On Turn Action. A new possessor becomes the owner after carrying it for ≥ 1hr.

**Sacrificial**: As an Instant Action on a hit, the wielder may take 1d8 damage & deal x2 that damage to the target. This damage may be enough to mortally wound the weapon's own wielder.

**Shield Breaking**: The weapon ignores all shields, both their AC bonus & their Shock protection. Mundane shields are destroyed by the weapon's attack, whether or not the attack hits.

**Shocking**: The weapon's Shock damage is increased by +2. If it has no natural Shock score, it gains a Shock rating of 2/AC 15.

**Skittering**: 1/Round when the weapon is shot or thrown at a spot w/in 60', the wielder can instantly appear where the weapon was thrown or struck as an On Turn Action (must do so in the same Round). If thrown they appear w/ the weapon in hand.

**Skytreading**: The weapon's bearer falls gently from any height, becoming immune to falling damage. By accepting 1 point of Strain as an On Turn Action, they may fly at their full normal movement rate until the end of the Round.

**Slaughtering**: Any foe brought to 0HP by the weapon is immediately killed & violently dismembered. Any enemies w/ a Morale score of < 12 w/in melee range of the victim take the weapon's Shock damage from horror, even if normally immune to Shock.

**Souleating**: 1/scene when the wielder kills a sentient foe w/ the weapon, they lose 1 point of Strain

**Spellcleaving**: 1/scene @ a cost of a Move Action & +1 Strain to the wielder, the weapon can apply a Dispel magic spell effect to any target point w/in its range. The spell is cast as if by a 10th level High Mage w/ a total Int/Magic Skill bonus of +3.

### Magic Armor
- Crafting Magical Armor & Shields requires a Mage & a Masterwork Item to Enchant. 2 Effects per item max.
- Armor's enchantment is measured from +1 to +3, which is added to its base AC. They can also possess magical abilities.
- Typically masterwork quality, so Є = 1 < the base armor (not for purposes of the Armored Magic Foci' limits). Most magic armor is adjustable to most humanoid wearers.
- The magic of a shield does not increase its AC bonus. Instead, they're empowered w/ unique abilities, & can't be shattered in combat.
- Abilities & bonuses granted by magical equipment do not stack.

**Augmented**: The bearer can carry four more points of Readied encumbrance. 1/scene, they can lift or briefly manipulate w/ brute strength anything a human possibly could.

**Bracing**: As a Move Action, the bearer can brace against one specific foe. Until they voluntarily move from their location, they're immune to Shock from that foe & can't be forcibly moved.

**Casting (HB)**: A War Shirt may be enchanted to allow a spellcaster the use of Spells & Arts unhindered while it is worn.

**Clotting**: 1/day, it automatically stabilizes an Mortally Wounded bearer.

**Feathery**: The user is immune to falling damage & can choose a landing site w/in 30 feet of their target.

**Feral**: At the cost of 1 Strain, the bearer can talk to animals for 1 scene who will reply w/ human intellect but bestial interests.

**Fireproof**: The bearer ignores the 1st 10 points of fire or heat damage they suffer each Round.

**Fortified**: The bearer ignores the 1st point of Strain they'd otherwise incur in a day.

**Graceful**: The bearer leaves no tracks & can't slip, trip, or be subject to forced movement by any man-sized foes.

**Harmonic**: An allied mage can cast a spell on it; the bearer is then immune to that spell until it is changed.

**Impervious**: 1/Round, the bearer ignores an instance of Shock they would otherwise have suffered.

**Inspiring**: Allies who can see the wearer gain a +1 Morale bonus & may reroll failed Mental Saves against emotion or thought-controlling effects.

**Lucky**: 1/day, as an Instant Action, turn a failed save into a success.

**Majestic**: Its magnificent appearance makes it socially acceptable wear in any situation or context.

**Sealed**: The bearer ignores toxic atmospheres, terrestrial temperature extremes, & has no need to breathe.

**Shifting**: The bearer can teleport up to 30' to a visible location as a Move Action.

**Shining**: It can emit light in a 30' radius at will. 1/day, On Turn Action, dazzle a melee foe to force a Phys Save or they lose their next Main Action.

**Silent**: It applies no penalty to Sneak Skill checks. If light armor or a shield, it grants a +1 bonus to the checks.

**Soaring**: Main action to move x2 their move rate through the air. They'll fall if they end the turn on an unsupported surface.

**Sustaining**: 1/day, cause the bearer to gain +1 Strain & lose all need for sleep, food, air, or drink for the next 24hrs.

**Thorned**: Successful grapple or unarmed attacks vs the wearer also inflict 1d6 damage to the attacker, plus any armor enhancement bonus.

**Transient**: It can vanish from its wearer & return as an On Turn Action 1/Round. It appears if they go unconscious or die.

**Unsleeping**: The bearer need not sleep, but will not get the benefits of a night's rest unless they do so.

**Vigilant**: The bearer can see normally even in deep mists or total darkness. They can't be surprised.

**Warded**: The GM chooses one weapon entry from the table on page 37. Non-magic weapons of that kind can't hurt the bearer, & magic ones do only half damage ↓. Neither inflicts Shock.

**Weightless**: 0 Encumbrance (does not apply to the Armored Magic Focus' limits or the armor's usual Skill check penalties).

### Cursed Items
- If a GM decides a risk exists: 1 in 20 chance the weapon is cursed.
- If an owner is separated from a binding cursed item, they can't lose Strain & gain +1 point each night until the item's return.
- A Dispel magic spell can disentangle the curse, but other times more elaborate magics or adventures are required.
- An item's curse makes the item dangerous or harmful to use, but not so awful that the party would discard it out of hand.

### Cursed Weapons & Armor

**Clumsy**: If the bearer doesn't choose to act last in initiative order, they can't use this item or attack w/ it.

**Draining**: Each scene in which the item is used, the bearer gains one System Strain.

**Enfeebled**: The weapon never inflicts Shock, regardless of the wielder's abilities or the target's AC.

**Heavy**: The item is x2 the usual Encumbrance cost.

**Ill-Omened**: Its bearer always fails saving throws on a roll of 19 or 20.

**Infuriating**: When carried, the bearer suffers +2 to all social check difficulties & a -1 penalty to the party's reaction rolls.

**Mundane**: May have hit & damage bonuses, it isn't counted as a magical weapon for purposes of affecting mundane-immune targets.

**Poisonous**: The user suffers 1d6 damage from its toxic substance or malign radiations at the end of each scene in which they use it.

**Refractory**: At the start of each scene that its bearer chooses to use it, roll 1d6. 1 = it refuses to work for the rest of the day.

**Screaming**: The item makes tremendous noise when used, making stealth impossible & possibly forcing a Wandering Encounter check.

**Traitorous**: On a nat 1 attack roll, the weapon strikes its owner. If armor is cursed, foes always hit on a 1 on the hit roll.

## Elixirs

### Elixir Basics
- Elixirs must be consumed as part of their activation, typically requiring a Main Action for a readied Elixir.
- An Elixir = 1Є when Readied. A GM may allow some to be packed together @ 0 Є but they'll be inaccessible in combat.
- Salves & unguents can't be applied to a hostile or resisting target.
- Identifying Elixirs requires a detection spell, legible label, tasting a drop to guess, or 1 day & a Wis or Int Magic check vs its creation DC. Only 1 chance. If elixir was tainted or fouled it may detect incorrectly.
- Elixirs aren't uncommon in dungeons. Purchasing them requires a relationship w/ a skilled brewer & a reason for them to brew.

### Elixir List

**Anchoring Draught**: Range: 10mi. Lasts 24hrs. Main Action: Imbiber teleports back to the spot they drank the potion, along w/ any objects & willing or incapacitated creatures they are carrying.

**Bestial Form**: Lasts Death or dawn. Imbiber changes into an animal they choose (≤ a horse, ≥ a rat). They gain the creature's means of movement & speed, but retain their stats. Belongings meld w/ them & maintain their benefits. On Turn Action to end.

**Blood of Boiling Rage**: Lasts 1 Scene. Roll attacks & damage w/ Adv. Every Round imbiber must attack or move to attack. Main Action & Mental Save to end. On failure: spend the next Round raging before trying again. Can't cast spells while raging.

**Bodily Innervation**: Rare. Once every 3 days it can decrease current Strain by -3.

**Borrowed Flesh**: A creature may transfer ≤ 6HP into the elixir by willingly adding their own blood & accepting an = amount of damage. This fleshy slurry lasts 1 month, during which the brew can be poured on a wounded subject to restore as much HP as was charged into it. The flesh mending the wound is the same as the donor, but will assimilate w/in months.

**Cold Courage**: The user of this potion is filled w/ invincible confidence for 1 scene. They attack w/ a Skill check instead of an attack roll @ DC = ½ the foe's AC↓. They are immune to mental effects that alter emotions. While under this influence, however, the GM tracks their HP & damage taken. The player is told only when they hit 0HP.

**Congealed Winter**: When opened or shattered, every water-based liquid w/in 20' instantly flash-freezes ≥ 1' deep, fires in range are extinguished, & living creatures take 2d6 damage. Vs liquid or fiery creatures the damage is max.

**Energetic Impermeability**: Grants immunity to the next harmful energy that would injure the imbiber w/in 1 scene. Protects from mundane sources of the energy & subtracts 15 damage from each hit by a magical source of that power. Energy forms include thermal, electrical, radiation, or caustic. Kinetic, psychic, & spiritual forms still harm. Does not change once set by the initial harm deflected.

**Murderous Anointing**: When applied to a weapon it gains a brief semi-sentience bent on bloodshed. For 1 scene, the wielder can accept +1 Strain to reroll a failed attack roll w/ the weapon, 1/failed attack. The treated weapon can't be used for nonlethal strikes.

**Nectar of Immortality**: Each bottle consumed adds an additional 1d6 years to the subject's healthy lifespan & cures all but the most sorcerously-potent afflictions. The nectar can't do > x2 the subject's natural lifespan, & after each dose there is a 1-in-20 chance the subject perishes in a hideous welter of cancers & growths.

**Nepenthe**: 1/lifetime this liquid can relieve a subject from mental trauma & cure madness. Insanity wrought by magic requires a Mental Save. On failure the draught can't break the curse.

**Omened Visions**: Pale blue powder that allows the user to explore the immediate future. Their next 15 min will play out in their visions, their actions chosen as they wish & their most probable consequences made evident in the dreamlike fugue, assuming those consequences are evident w/in the next 15 min. While under this effect the subject is oblivious to the mundane world.

**Persistent Luminescence**: When applied or imbibed the target glows 30' (persists 1 week or until dispelled).

**Plasmic Molding**: When applied to a mundane object smaller than a large door it becomes malleable as clay for 1 scene. At the end of the scene, the material hardens back to its original consistency in whatever form it now takes. If taken by a living creature, they may reshape their own body to a degree, taking any appearance that a creature of their species might naturally have. This alteration lasts until dispelled or the user ends it, but they can't recover Strain while so altered.

**Quintessence of the Hour**: When imbibed, the user is whisked back to a perfect temporal parallel of time from their past, occupying the body they had for 1hr. They may do as they wish in that time & place, but if they die in that hour, they die in the present as well. At the hour's end their mind is returned to the present. Nothing that happened in the facsimile has any effect on true reality, but things they learned or observed during that hour may be retained.

**Sacrificial Strength**: When imbibed, the user is capable of channeling their own life force into the damage they do. One time w/in the next scene, as an Instant Action, they may sacrifice a # of HP of their choice when they damage a target. Every 4HP = +1d6 (5d6 max). The user must retain ≥ 1HP & the bonus damage can be applied to only 1 target of a damaging Action.

**Sanctified Healing**: When applied to a target, it heals 1d6+1 HP instantly.

**Scalding Breath**: The imbiber of this fluid can exhale it again as a Main Action to do 4d6 + level damage to all targets w/in a cone 30' long & wide. Victims make an Evasion Save for ½ damage. Different fluids produce different noxious exhalations. Flame, frost, poison, & radiation are not uncommon. Only 1 breath attack is allowed, & if not made w/in a scene the potion is wasted.

**Soul Sight**: If applied to a creature's eyes this salve inhibits tasks like reading, but not fighting, & allows the creature to see living entities as glowing colored outlines regardless of light or invisibility. They can identify individuals by their glow, & the glow reveals the subject's current mental state as described in 1 or 2 words. Lasts for 6 hrs or until rinsed from their eyes.

**Truthspeaking**: When applied to, the user must envision a specific query before anointing a restrained, willing, or helpless sentient target w/ the potion. The subject makes a Mental Save to resist. Failure = they tell the user a truthful, undeceptive answer to the question in < 5 sentences. Success = the elixir is tainted & instead the target will instead give the answer the user thinks is most plausible. The user can't discern the result of the target's save, except by their own good judgment of the answer.

**Wrathful Detonation**: These flasks are permanently sealed & when hurled w/ intention never miss. They detonate for 2d6 damage to all targets w/in 15', w/ a range of 60'. They will not explode by accident, & only 1 flask can be hurled at a time.

## Magical Devices

Arcane objects of wonder. Below are listed only a small section of possibilities.

**Censer of Solid Dreams**: Lasts 1 scene. Main Action. 1/day when filled w/ fuel & lit it exhales smoke that the bearer can mold w/ mental commands into a solid, simple object ≤ 30' cube. It is opaque & requires 5HP of damage to punch a human-sized hole through it. Creatures caught w/in the smoke can tear through it w/ a Main Action. Can bear the weight of horses.

**Congealed Paradox**: Main Action. When broken, active magic w/in 20' is dispelled & no further spells, arts, or magic power use can be performed inside it for 1 scene. Creatures reliant on magic to exist take 5d6 damage each Round spent w/in its AoE.

**Enough Rope**: Always be precisely long enough for the task at hand. The rope can bear ≤ 1 ton & can't be cut by mundane means. So long as the owner is touching the rope, they can cause it to untie itself or retract fully back into their grip.

**Eye of Discernment**: An eye made of jade. It can penetrate any mundane disguise or magical spell x1 before turning to dust.

**Flask of Devils**: 1/day, if opened, a devil leaps from the bottle (stats = to a creature of the Calculation of the Phantasmal Eidolon spell). The devil demands its liberator give it a command, which is followed until the scene is over or task completed. Once completed it returns into the flask. Use of the flask adds +1 Strain, +1d3 if the devil is killed (a new devil will be summoned the next time the flask is opened). If this Strain puts the user over their max, they're dragged into the flask to become its new devil.

**Ghost Horse**: A fist-sized crystal that manifests a crystal steed. Main Action to summon. Can carry its summoner + 35Є for 12hrs before needing an = amount of time to recharge. Move 60'. Can cross any terrain a mountain goat or small boat could. Natural animals shy away from the beast. 13AC, 10HP, can't fight, & if destroyed it collapses back into its crystal. Can't be recalled for 1 wk.

**Immanent Beacon Shard**: When activated & released the crystal remains fixed precisely in that location. No mundane force can shift or damage it. DC12 to dispel the effect w/ magic. The person who placed the shard is aware of its location, & can see & hear the area around it. The user can reclaim the beacon at a cost of +1 Strain, or wait for the effect to wear out 1 day later.

**Implacable Fist**: Grants the user an inhuman grip strength. W/ 1 Round to build force it can crush any mundane material it grips. Magical materials require a Str/Exert check vs +8DC. Impractical to use as a weapon in combat or grappling. Any object carried in that hand has a 1 in 6 chance of being crushed accidentally by the wearer's reaction to combat or other sudden stress.

**Lens of the Polychrome Lord**: Palm-sized lenses concentrate light into a lethal beam. In direct sunlight the beam does 5d6 damage to a target w/in 300' (Evasion Save negates). In ordinary lighting the effect does 3d6, & if the chamber is dark save for portable light sources the damage is 1d6. If the lens is used > 1/day there is a 1 in 4 chance it shatters after each bolt.

**Lex Talionis**: Often daggers or the like, they function as ordinary +1 magical weapons, but when they harm a target the victim must make a Phys Save or both the target & the wielder instantly die, w/ no chance to stabilize. If the weapon is used as part of an Execution attack, no save. The weapon then vanishes.

**Logos**: No sentient can look upon a logos & not recognize its power. A mage can expend a logos as a substitute for > 250k $p worth of ingredients for creating magic items. If used to fuel a magic item's creation, no further special ingredients are required.

**Lyre of Longing**: 1/day when played by a competent musician for ≥ 5min, listeners w/in 30' must make a Mental Save or be seized by a desire for a particular thing or purpose imagined by the player. This longing will not make them act out of character, but they will perform all normally-conceivable actions in order to obtain the object of their longing, including quarreling fiercely w/ their fellows if this object can't be shared. The enchantment lasts 1 scene.

**Memorious Fragrance**: An incense stick that never burns out. Lighting the item as a Main Action allows the activator to spread a subtle haze of scented mist in a 20' radius. The user may then describe a memory they wish others to have; all w/in 20' except the user must make Mental Saves or have the memory implanted. They may not realize this memory exists unless brought to their attention or questioned about it. The memory persists until magically dispelled. This item can't alter or erase existing memories.

**Purification Salt**: If the salt is used on an object or weapon as a Main Action it can interact w/ incorporeal entities as if solid for 1 scene. If hurled it does 3d6 damage to mages, unnatural magical creatures, or incorporeal beings. If consumed by a creature, it fills the imbiber w/ a sense of guilt & sorrow, inflicting 3d6 emotional damage. Creatures reduced to 0HP regain 1HP but will attempt suicide. A pinch of salt can be taken from the bag each scene, but any existing pinches evaporate once a new one is taken.

**Rain-Beckoning Drum**: Produces an immediate deluge of rain in a 100' radius around the user when it is beaten rhythmically. The rain lasts ≤ 1 Round but will drop 3" of water on all surfaces w/in the area of effect; if used indoors, the rain issues from the room's ceiling. The drum can be used safely 1/wk. Each additional time it is used in the same wk, it adds 1 Strain to the user.

**Seed of Flesh**: Main Action. Lasts 1 scene. This small, fleshy seed can be thrown & sprouts into a copy of the creature that threw it, albeit naked & unequipped, w/ 6 HP. It can't cast spells or use arts, but will obey even suicidal commands.

**Stonepeg**: These devices are always found in groups of 1d4+2 pegs, each appearing to be a glyphed metal rod ~1' in length w/ a chisel-shaped tip. If thrust firmly into a stone or earthen surface, the peg will effortlessly sink into the material & become as firm & fixed as if it were cemented in place. The peg can only be freely removed by the person who sank it into place, otherwise requiring that it be chiseled out w/ a scene's Effort & the correct tools.

**Stutter Hatchet**: +1 hand axe. Inanimate matter damaged by the hatchet will return to its unbroken state @ dawn if the flat of the axe is tapped against its largest fragment of it. If destroyed thoroughly fragments may be missing from the reformed object.

**Vessel of Hours**: Instant Action. The bearer can invoke this clock-like object to undo their actions & any consequences for the immediate turn, resetting their turn back to its beginning. This object & others of its kind will only work once for any given user.

**Vothite Icon**: Range: 30'. Requires 1 free hand & LoS. Main Action. When a human/demihuman 1st sees this incomprehensible icon, they must make a Mental Save. Failure = loss of their next Round's Action. Can't affect the same creature x2.

## Land Ownership & Domains

- A business or ag land produces ~10% (-5% taxes to lords) of its purchase price in income each year, assuming all goes well.
- Each year roll 1d6. 1 = something will go wrong the following yr & there will be no income unless the PCs can fix the problem.
- Rolling 1 2yrs in a row = Property's financial collapse unless saved by PCs. Ag land never fails shy of war or natural disaster.

## Building Magical Workings

### Workings Basics
- A Working is a stationary, persistent magic that persists until destroyed or decayed.
- Workings require a 6th level Mage or Partial Mage caster. If the designer's Level x Magic Skill x 2 ≥ the Working's DC, they can establish it alone. If ≥ ½ DC, they will need to find other mages to make up the difference. If < ½ the DC, the Working is too difficult.
- Player discusses the goal, & the GM sets the DC. Total cost of the Working = most costly element + 1/2 the rest ↑.
- Workings are constructed @ a time cost of 1 month + 1 week per 5 points of DC or fraction thereof.
- x2 cost = ½ time (only applies to the magical components of the Working. Mundane structures must be built prior).

### Step #4 Choose Foci

- Some Foci raise Skill (-1 to -0, -0 to +1…) Can't raise a Skill past Level+1 @ character creation. Choose a different Skill (not Magic).
- After Creation, instead of Foci raising Skills by tiers, Foci grant 3 Skill Points towards future purchase of the Skills next tier.
- After Creation, Foci can raise Skills past PC Level Caps. Skill+4 Max. @ Skill+4 choose another Skill to apply Points towards.
- A Warrior Foci is any the GM deems. An Expert Foci is any the GM deems.

**ALERT**:

**Level 1**: Gain Notice. Can't be surprised. Immune to Execution attacks. Roll w/ Advantage for Initiative.

**Level 2**: You always act 1st in the combat Round unless another also has Alert.

**ARMORED MAGIC**:

**Level 1**: You can use spells or arts while wearing armor whose Encumbrance is ≤ 2. You can use a shield while casting, provided your other hand is empty for gesturing.

**Level 2**: You can cast spells while wearing armor of any Encumbrance. You can cast w/ both hands full, but not bound.

**ARMSMASTER**:

(Not applicable to unarmed or non-thrown weapons. Doesn't stack w/ other Foci that add a Skills level to damage or Shock.)

**Level 1**: Gain Stab. Ready a Stowed melee or thrown weapon as an Instant Action. Add your Stab Skill level to a melee or thrown weapon's damage roll or Shock damage (assuming it has any).

**Level 2**: Shock from your melee attacks always treats the target as AC 10. +1 bonus to hit w/ all thrown or melee attacks.

**ARTISAN**:

Create Mods even if you are not an Expert.

**Level 1**: Gain Craft. Your Craft Skill is treated as 1 level higher (max of +5) for purposes of crafting & maintaining Mods. Mods you build require 1 fewer unit of arcane salvage (min of 1). Craft any profession's work w/o penalty.

**Level 2**: 1st Mod added to item requires no Maintenance & ½ the typical silver cost (this benefit stacks w/ masterwork 1st Mod benefit). You auto succeed to build masterwork gear, & 1/month you can reduce a created Mod's salvage cost by 1 further unit (min of 0).

**ASSASSIN**:

**Level 1**: Gain Sneak. Conceal an object no larger than a knife from anything less than a strip search. Draw this object as an On Turn Action, & your point-blank thrown or melee attacks made during a surprise Round w/ it can't miss.

**Level 2**: You can take a Move Action the same Round you make an Execution attack. You may split the Movement when making an Execution attack to before & after the attack. This movement is too quick to alert a victim or be hindered by guards.

**AUTHORITY**:

**Level 1**: Gain Lead. 1/day make a request of an NPC who is not openly hostile to you, rolling a Cha/Lead Skill check @ a DC = to the NPC's Morale score. On success they will comply, provided the request is not very harmful or highly uncharacteristic.

**Level 2**: Any NPC being directly led by you gains a Morale & hit roll bonus = to your Lead Skill & a +1 bonus on all Skill checks. Your followers & henchmen will not act against your interests unless under extreme pressure.

**BERSERKER (CUPOFCOFFE HB)**:

(Only Warriors or Partial Warriors can take this Focus.)

**Level 1**: 1/Combat, you may enter a fury as a Move Action, & end it as an On Turn Action. While in the fury you can choose to make your attack & damage rolls w/advantage, however until the start of your next turn, foes roll attack & damage w/ advantage against you. You are immune to mental effects that would alter your emotions while in the fury.

**Level 2**: When dropped to 0 HP for the 1st time in the fury, you may continue to fight for a # of Rounds = to either Stab or Punch before falling Mortally Wounded. Additional damage taken during this time (shy of catastrophic) can't stop or kill you. If healed during this time, you stabilize, but the ability's benefits end.

**CLOSE COMBATANT**:

**Level 1**: Gain any combat Skill. You can use knife-sized thrown weapons in melee w/o suffering penalties for the proximity of melee attackers. You ignore Shock damage from melee assailants, even if you're unarmored @ the time (invoking this benefit disrupts any spellcasting you might do that Round due to the need for violently active evasion). (Still susceptible to Shock from Swarm attacks)

**Level 2**: The Shock damage from your melee attacks treats all targets as if they were AC 10. The Fighting withdrawal combat Act is treated as an On Turn Action for you & can be performed freely.

**CONNECTED**:

**Level 1**: Gain Connect. If you've spent ≥ a week in a not-entirely-hostile location, you'll have built a web of contacts willing to do favors for you that are ≤ mildly illegal. You can call on 1 favor per game day & the GM decides how far they'll go for you.

**Level 2**: 1/session, if not entirely implausible, you meet someone you know who is willing to do modest favors for you. You can decide when & where to meet this person, but the GM decides who they are & what they can do for you.

**CULTURED**:

**Level 1**: Gain Connect. You fluently speak all the common languages of your native region & convey basic information in uncommon ones. You can learn a new language w/ a wk's practice w/ a native speaker. 1/day your polished ways automatically gain a minor favor from a non-hostile NPC, so long as it would not cost them significant expense or risk.

**Level 2**: 1/session, reroll a failed social Skill check.

**DANGER SENSE**:

(Experts/Partial Experts only. Only 1 foci such as this may be taken by any single PC. Effects are non-magical.)

**Level 1**: Gain Notice. You & those near you become immune to execution attacks. 1/day before triggering a trap, an ambush, or taking action that would likely result in harm or death, you sense the danger in time to stop yourself.

**Level 2**: Gain a +1 to your Wisdom modifier (+2 Max). 1/day, as an Instant action, when faced w/danger, you receive an intuitive sense of the safest course of action to minimize losses for yourself & your allies, as determined by the GM.

**DEADEYE**:

(Applies to all ranged & thrown weapons. Does not stack w/ Armsmaster).

**Level 1**: Gain Shoot. You can Ready a Stowed ranged weapon as an Instant Action. You may use a bow or two-handed ranged weapon even when a foe is w/in melee range, albeit @ a -4 hit penalty. You may add your Shoot Skill level to a ranged weapon's damage roll.

**Level 2**: You can reload weapons w/ the Slow Reload trait as an On Turn Action. You can use ranged weapons in melee w/o penalty. 1/scene, as an On Turn Action when shooting an inanimate target, you auto hit unless you roll a 2 on your Skill check or the shot is impossible.

**DEALMAKER**:

**Level 1**: Gain Trade. W/ a ½hr of searching you can find a buyer or seller for any legal or illegal good or service available in the community. Finding rare services (king-slaying assassins, precious artifacts…) may require an adventure.

**Level 2**: 1/session, target a sentient who is not trying to kill you or your allies @ that moment. Make a request of it that it can comprehend. If plausible for it to agree to such terms it will do so for a price. The price for major favors may be dear.

**DEVELOPED ATTRIBUTE**:

(Can't be taken by Mages/Partial Mages)

**Level 1**: +1 to a chosen Attribute Mod (the Score does not change). The mod may increase again if later advancement improves the Score enough (max Mod bonus of +2). You can choose this Focus more than once to improve different Attributes. (HB)

**DIE HARD**:

**Level 1**: Gain +2 max HP per level. This bonus applies retroactively if you take this Focus after 1st level. You automatically stabilize if Mortally Wounded, provided your body is not destroyed.

Creatures of a level > the caster make Mental Saves to end the spell the 1st time each day its given orders it finds greatly objectionable.

All such targets ≤4 HD w/in that area fall unconscious instantly, & can be roused only by damage or a Main Action. Nonsleeping beings are immune to this spell.

**SUMMON FAMILIAR LEVEL 2**: Lasts until dismissed or dawn. Conjures an intelligent familiar (1HP x Caster level, AC 14, Mv 30', SV = caster's, Skill +0, No attack).

**DISPEL MAGIC LEVEL 2**: Range: 100' x Caster level. AoE: 20' radius centered on a visible point. Caster removes unwanted magical effects from that area.

Spells can't permanently suppress standing magical effects. Requires an opposed roll to temporarily suppress them. If successful, the effect is negated for 1d6 Rounds.

**GREATER DOMINATE PERSON LEVEL 4**: Lasts Until dispelled, death, or release. Requires a helpless or restrained living victim. Target makes a Mental Save to resist.

Objects too heavy or affixed do not swap. Unwilling targets w/ > 4HD make a Mental Save to resist.

**WARPGATE LEVEL 4**: Lasts 1 Round x Caster level or until dropped (Instant Action). Range: 100' x level. The caster opens a short-ranged spatial rift between 2 points, provided they can see or have physically occupied both points @ some prior time & provided the 2 points are ≥ 20' apart. The rift forms a gateway that connects the 2 points (large enough to drive a cart through) & allows subjects on either side to see & pass through the gate. Environmental qualities such as liquids or atmospheres will not pass through the portal; only intentionally-directed creatures & objects. Once the creature has passed through a portal, it can't pass through again until its next turn. Creatures partially in a rift when it closes are spat out on the far side.

**CONTROL WIND LEVEL 4**: AoE:a line 100' long & 30' wide. Caster conjures a fierce gust of wind.

The spell can't summon extreme weather, but can call rain & conventional storms sufficient to cause flooding in areas prone to it.

**TIME STOP LEVEL 5**: Lasts 1d4+1 Rounds. Affects the caster & up to 1 visible ally x Caster level. Targets briefly step outside of time, & the rest of the world freezes around them.

### Druid Spells

**DELUDE BEAST LEVEL 1**: Targets up to 1d6 beasts + 1 per caster level. Range: 100'. Duration: While the caster is present & 1 hour after departed. Beasts already in combat or in fear for their lives are unaffected. Mental Save. Failure = their senses are under the control of the caster, who can make them see, smell, or hear what they wish. If a delusion would put them in physical danger the spell breaks. The caster cannot change the illusions once they've left the target's presence.

**ENTHRALL BEAST LEVEL 1**: Requires a visible beast w/in 100'. Mental Save. Failure = the beast becomes docile & obedient to the caster (obeys verbal orders w/ a human intellect so long as they are neither suicidal nor contrary to its nature). The beast will fight for the caster, provided the odds are not overwhelming. The caster can have a # of enthralled beasts = to their level or a total hit dice of beasts ≤ 2x the caster's level, whichever is fewer.

**SEASONAL GROWTH LEVEL 1**: Requires 1 hr to cast while the mage paces the boundaries of the area to be affected, ≤ 1 acre x caster level. Once cast, the plant life w/in the area gains ≤ 1 yr of growth. This gain is uniform & indiscriminate. One acre of a peasant crop will yield enough to feed 2 people for 1 year, or 3 if the field is carefully prepared beforehand. This spell can't be cast again w/in a 1 mi radius until next spring.

**SHAPE PLANTS LEVEL 1**: Bend & shape or destroy all living, non magical plant material w/in 1 contiguous 10' cube x caster level. Requires 5 min to shape, but destruction of matter is instant. If used against plant-based monsters, the spell does 1d10 damage x caster level (Physical Save for ½). Cutting through magically shaped barriers takes 5hp x caster level of damage to cut a man-sized hole, & requires weapons suitable for chopping wood. The plants can be shaped w/ enough precision to make crude tools that have no moving parts.

**WOOD WARD LEVEL1**: Requires 1 visible subject w/in 30' x caster level. Lasts 1 scene. Target becomes immune to non-magical wooden or wood-hafted weapons or implements, as well as plant-derived toxins, spores, or glues. This spell can cure poisonings or infestations.

**BEAST PELLET LEVEL 2**: Requires a dead, mostly-intact beast ≤ an ox & 1 week. Magical spores cover the corpse, causing it to shrink to a marble sized pellet. The caster may hurl the pellet w/in 30' as a Main Action, whereupon the beast will reappear fully intact, albeit undead. It obeys the caster's spoken commands w/ human intellect & suicidal devotion. The beast withers away to dust 1 hr after summoning. The caster may have no more pellets at once than their level, & each pellet they carry subtracts 1 point from their maximum System Strain.

**BEAST SHAPE LEVEL 2**: The caster may adopt the outward semblance of any normal beast or plant < an ox & > a mouse. They gain the movement rating of the beast & its ability to breathe water or endure natural temperature extremes, but the caster's other statistics, senses, or unarmed attacks are unchanged. Any worn or held equipment merges w/ the beast form & continues to confer its usual AC or weapon statistics; the caster cannot change gear or drop items until the spell ends. Lasts until dispelled, next dawn, or ended as an On Turn action.

**SICKLES OF BONE LEVEL 2**: Requires ≤ 1 willing target x caster level. Range 30'. Targets grow long, sharp claws of bone for 1 hr x caster level. Targets are capable of clawing 2 in/min through plant matter. These claws do not hinder the user's dexterity, but count as magical weapons (1d8 damage, Shock 2/15, attribute = Str or Dex). If the caster is the target, they may use Magic instead of Stab or Punch as the combat skill. If cast on a creature that already has claws, fangs, or other natural weapons (not including unarmed-trained humans) the creature gains a bonus to damage rolls & Shock equal to the caster's level.

**TRACE THE PATH LEVEL 2**: The caster must focus on the image of a person or a type of creature when casting this spell. The plant life around the mage immediately telepathically directs the caster in the direction of whatever creature last fit the description, provided the tracked target would be perceptible to human senses. The plant life continues to lead the caster for up to 1hr x level, though the spell ends at dusk or when the caster casts another spell.

**BEAST WARD LEVEL 3**: Caster must pace off an area ≤ 1 acre x level, or spend a Main Action indicating a straight line ≤ 40' long w/in 100'. Wild beasts will not cross into the warded area or pass the indicated line unless permitted by the caster. Creatures who somehow end up in the area will think of nothing but fleeing it. Area wards persist as long as the caster remains inside them. Line wards or abandoned areas cease to protect 1 hr x level afterwards. Beasts incapable of feeling fear are unaffected by this spell.

**FERAL BARGAIN LEVEL 3**: This spell does not function in combat, & must be cast on a beast w/in 50' of the caster. The spell immediately opens a telepathic link w/ the target, after which the caster must offer something that the beast would reasonably want in exchange for a service from the beast. Even a hostile creature will spend a few mins parlaying unless directly threatened, & will negotiate w/ a human level of intelligence. If the mage can offer a suitable price for the creature's cooperation, the bargain will be made & the creature will be bound to perform it w/ human intelligence if they are capable of doing it & it is not suicidally dangerous. If the caster fails to keep their end of the bargain under the same terms, however, they must make a Mental save to avoid immediate death from the psychic backlash.

**PLANT WALK LEVEL 3**: Requires a willing target w/in 30' touching a plant of a volume ≥ their body. Once cast, the spell's recipient disappears into the plant. As a Main Action, they can step out of any plant of similar or larger size w/in 100' x caster level. Optionally, they can instead cast their senses to such a target plant & observe their surroundings as if standing there. Lasts 15 min or ends when the subject steps out of a plant. Damage inflicted on a plant while the subject is hiding in it is done to them as well.

**FORCE BEAST SHAPE LEVEL 4**: Functions as Beast Shape but can target even an unwilling creature w/in 100' (Physical save negates). If the creature is of a level > the caster, it rolls its Save w/ Advantage. The shifted creature retains its own stats, but drops its possessions when it changes. Lasts until dispelled or ended. Each week spent as an animal they must succeed a Mental save or succumb to the beast's nature & forget their prior life forever, gaining the attributes of the natural animal. If killed in animal shape they remain an animal in death.

**HARMONIOUS PASSAGE LEVEL 4**: Affects the caster & up to 3 other visible allies x caster level. So long as the spell is maintained, those protected are immune to plant or animal derived toxins or spores & are considered inedible by beasts, who will ignore them unless greatly provoked. They leave no mundanely-perceptible trace of their passage over unpaved earth & are immune to inclement weather, provided the atmosphere is not outright unsurvivable. Lasts until dawn, or until a subject voluntarily harms a beast or large plant.

**CLAIM DOMAIN LEVEL 5**: Requires 5 hrs & a full moon. Once cast, all the land w/in 1 mi x caster level is accounted part of the caster's domain. W/in this space, beasts will obey them w/ human intelligence in any way not contrary to their nature. The caster may speak w/ animals & plants w/in this area as if they had human intellect. They will also become intuitively aware of the location of any groups > 24 people traveling or living together. This domain cannot overlap w/ a prior caster's domain, & it has no power w/in the walls or boundary markers of human settlements or cities. A caster may maintain only 1 domain at a time.

**REND STRUCTURE LEVEL 5**: Range 200'. Affects only non magical structures. Plantlife erupts from the surface of the structure, their roots ripping it apart w/in 6 secs. The spell can affect only 1 structure or wall segment at a time & destroy no more than a 100' cube of it. The caster has very fine control of the demolition & can destroy only selective smaller parts of a structure, or prevent the demolition from harming those in or around the building. If not so careful, anyone w/in the structure takes 10d6 damage (Evasion save for ½).

The caster makes a direct appeal to a mundane mass of earth, stone, water, flame, or air no larger than a 10' cube. At the end of the Round, the mass will move or reshape itself w/in that space as the caster requests.

**ELEMENTAL SPY LEVEL 1**: Lasts 1 day x Caster level, or until the charmed object is destroyed, dispersed, or consumed. The caster enchants a stone, 1 oz of liquid, a flame ≤ a candle… As a Main Action the caster can see & hear as if present by the object.

**FLY LEVEL 2**: Lasts ≤ 4th level casters = 1 scene, 5th-7th level = 1 hr, ≥ 8th level = until next dawn or dusk; or dispelled. Requires a visible ally w/in 100'. The target gains flight (x2 usual movement rate). If the spell ends while aloft the target floats gently to earth.

**FORM TUNNEL LEVEL 2**: AoE: ≤ 20' long (or 2' for worked stone) x Caster level, & ≤ 10' wide & tall. Caster carves a tunnel through natural stone or earth. The caster can choose to make the tunnel stable & sound or allow it to collapse naturally. Magical stone or earth can't be altered by this spell. The caster has basic control over the direction & interior features of the tunnel, & can form simple structures w/in it.

**CONTINUAL FLAME LEVEL 2**: Lasts Until dispelled, extinguished, or dropped. A flame no larger than the caster is made effectively eternal. It consumes no fuel, though it may be used to burn or heat other things, & it resists extinguishing save being buried or wholly immersed in water. The caster can temporarily extinguish it @ will. A # of such flames can be created = to the Caster level; beyond that, special ingredients & fuels are needed that cost 500 silver pieces per flame. If used as a weapon, it adds +2 damage to a successful hit (nothing to Shock).

**PACT OF ELEMENTAL RESISTANCE LEVEL 2**: Lasts 1 scene. Requires a visible target. The target is immune to injury caused by mundane manifestations of earth, water, fire, or wind (as chosen by the caster). Stone weapons don't harm them, water doesn't drown them, fire doesn't burn them, & wind doesn't topple them. This affects secondary effects of the material as well; a fire-pacted mage couldn't be boiled in a pot, & an earth-pacted one won't be suffocated if buried alive.

**ELEMENTAL WALL LEVEL 3**: Lasts 1 scene. Range: 200' from caster. AoE: 10' long x Caster level, w/ a height of 10' & a thickness of 1 ft. Calls forth a wall of a chosen elemental force which must rest on solid ground & may be shaped as desired. Earthen walls are impervious to anything but mining tools or rock-shattering strength, taking 20 HP of damage to knock a man-sized hole in them. Fire walls inflict 3d6 damage + the Caster level to any who pass through. Water walls spin & hurl creatures ≤ ox-size who pass through them, ejecting them @ a random point on the far side of the wall & doing 2d6 damage. Air walls are invisible, inaudible, & 20' in height; those who cross them suffer 1d6 + the Caster level in electrical damage.

**BECOME ELEMENT LEVEL 3**: Lasts 1 scene. The caster charges their physical shape w/ the qualities of a chosen element.

- **Stone**: automatically stabilize @ 0HP & ignore the 1st 3 points of damage from any source.
- **Water**: may pass through gaps a mouse could.
- **Air**: fly @ your move rate & gain a +4 AC vs ranged attacks.
- **Fire**: inflict 1d6 damage to all creatures in melee range @ the start of their turn each Round & gain immunity to heat damage.

In all cases, they need not breathe & gain immunity to poisons & diseases not already w/in them.

**GASEOUS FORM LEVEL 3**: Lasts 1 scene or target or caster ends. Requires a visible target. The creature & their possessions are briefly transformed into a misty cloud, only vulnerable to sources that could harm a cloud. They may pass freely into any area that a vapor could & move freely in 3 dimensions @ their movement rate. Can't physically handle objects.

**CALCIFY LEVEL 4**: Lasts Until dispelled or caster ends. Range 100'. Requires a visible target. Target must make a Phys Save or be turned to stone. Affects any size of living creature. Objects > a cart are unaffected. Objects being held or worn by someone else get a Phys Save made by their user. If the target is damaged while petrified, it may be harmed or killed upon its restoration. If the target's Save was successful, it is slowed & loses its Move Action for the 1d6 Rounds.

**ELEMENTAL GUARDIAN LEVEL 4**: Lasts until destroyed or the next dawn. The caster imbues a human-sized mass of earth, water, fire, or air w/ a crude awareness & an eagerness to defend them. Guardian Stats: HD 4, AC 15, MV 40', Skill +1, SV 13+, Instinct 0, Morale 12, melee attack of +6/1d10, no Shock. **Earth**: HD 6. **Fire**: 5/- Shock damage. **Water**: AC 18. **Air**: Flies @ its rate of movement. Has human intelligence; can communicate w/ others & handle objects. Serves w/ suicidal devotion. Limit of 1 elemental summoned @ a time & if destroyed a new elemental can't be summoned in the same scene.

**FURY OF THE ELEMENTS LEVEL 5**: Range: 200' x Caster level. AoE 30' of target point. Molten rock, searing wind, & steam erupt to ravage a target point causing 10d6 damage. Convention structures are destroyed. The target point moves 1d6x10' in a random direction @ the start of the next Round, blasting everything in its path. The point wanders for 1d6 Rounds before ending. Molten remnants persist after the spell ends, a hazard for any who enter the area for the rest of the day.

**EARTHQUAKE LEVEL 5**: Requires a visible point & 5 min for effects to fully manifest. AoE: radius ≤ 500'. Caster calls a deep tremor which can destroy any structures, tunnels, or caves w/in the AoE unless such structures are magically reinforced. The effects are negated if dispelled w/in 1 min of its casting; after that it's too late to stop.

**BONETALKER**: Effort: Scene. You can see & communicate w/ undead creatures regardless of language or invisibility. You can sense surface thoughts of visible undead.

**FALSE DEATH**: Effort: Indefinite. Instant Action. While Commited you appear dead to mundane examination. You lose your Main Actions while "dead", but can move & perceive normally & do not need to eat, drink, breathe, or perform bodily functions. While "dead" poisons & diseases do not progress.

**UNAGING**: Effort: None. You no longer naturally age & remain hale & vigorous up to your species' natural max age + 20% x character level, after which you collapse into dust & decay. True immortality is possible, but requires consistent supplies of life energy, occult materials, or other difficult-to-acquire or morally questionable materials. You are immune to poison & disease.

**MARTIAL STYLE**: At third level, any attack using the Punch skill counts as a magic weapon.

**UNARMED MIGHT**: Your unarmed attack damage increases as you gain levels. You may add your Punch skill to the damage done by these attacks as usual, but Foci such as Unarmed Combatant that improve your usual Punch damage do not apply to you.

- Punch Shock begins at 1/15 @ level 1, increases to 2/15 @ level 2, 3/15 @ level 6, & 4/15 @ level 9.
- Punch damage begins at 1d6 @ level 1, increases to 1d8 @ level 3, 1d10 @ level 5, 1d10+1 @ level 7, 1d10+2 @ level 9, & 1d10+3 @ level 10.

**BRUTAL COUNTER**: Effort: Scene. Instant action. After resolving an enemy melee attack against you, whether it hits or misses, you may make a free physical attack against your assailant, using either a normal attack or some other offensive ability that takes no more than 1 Main Action to execute. You cannot use this art > once per round vs a single foe, but you may use it while performing a Total Defense.

**FAULTLESS AWARENESS**: Your awareness is such that you cannot be surprised, & will even wake from a sound sleep in time to respond normally to some imminent peril.

**HURLING THROW**: After you make a successful attack, you may Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action. The target must make a Physical Save or be thrown up to 10' in any direction, falling prone on landing & suffering the damage rolled for your attack.

**MASTER'S VIGOR**: Your body retains its vigor & youthful vitality to the full normal span of your life. You regain 2 lost hp per hour due to your natural restorative powers.

**MOB JUSTICE**: Effort: Day. Instant action. Become impervious to the Make a Swarm Attack maneuver. Your assailants cannot use this maneuver against you for the rest of the scene, & you become immune to Shock as long as you remain in melee w/ ≥ 2 foes. Making use of this benefit disrupts any spellcasting you may attempt, however, due to the violent motion required.

**NIMBLE ASCENT**: Effort: Scene. On Turn action. For the remainder of the scene you may move up vertical & overhanging surfaces & across difficult terrain at your full movement rate w/ no chance of slipping or falling, provided the surface is not glass-smooth or enchanted.

**PURIFIED BODY**: Effort: Day. Instant action. Use to cure any disease or poison currently affecting you, or instead to negate any need for sleep, food, water, or air for the next 24 hours.

**REVIVIFYING BREATH**: Effort: Day. On Turn action. Limit: 1/scene. Heal yourself for 1d6 hp + your level. This healing does not increase Strain. This ability may be used on your turn even when you are at 0 hp, but in such a case it Commits all your remaining Effort for the day.

**SHATTERING STRIKE**: Effort: Day. Requires 1 full round of motionlessness to prepare. On the next round, as a Main Action, your unarmed attack can shatter a wooden door, wooden wall, or other similar object up to a depth of 1' x level & a width sufficient to allow a man-sized creature to pass through. At 4th level this ability improves to affect even a stone wall & at 7th it can affect even a metal wall or solid iron door. The blow is useless against a target that can move, but against an immobilized creature the attack does 1d12 damage x level.

**STYLE WEAPONRY**: Pick 3 general classes of weapons (swords, bows, axes, daggers, etc). When using weapons of those classes, you may use Punch for hit rolls instead of Stab or Shoot. Your Punch skill does not add to the damage done by these weapons, however, though the benefits of Martial Style apply to their hit rolls.

**UNOBTRUSIVE STEP**: You not only possess a considerable skill for disguise & obfuscation, you can become extremely hard to detect. Once per scene, you may Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to reroll a failed Sneak skill check or skill check related to impersonating someone else.

### Rules Concerning Animal Companions

- A Beastmaster is limited to 1 companion animal at a time. An animal can be left in any terrain suitable for its survival. Unless killed before the Beastmaster's return, the creature can be expected to be found in the same vicinity later. Released creatures are usually friendly to the Beastmaster still, unless mistreated or exceptionally savage.
- A companion animal functions as an independent allied creature. It will obey commands from the Beastmaster that aren't contrary to its nature or beyond its intellect, & will fight, move, check Instinct & Morale, & act independently in combat.
- If the creature is mistreated or used as cannon fodder, it can flee or turn on its former master.
- A companion animal can't have a number of HD > the Beastmaster's level +1.
- A companion animal can't have human levels of intelligence.
- A companion animal must be given a name by the Beastmaster.

### Arts of the Beastmaster

Beastmaster Effort is calculated w/ Survive. Max Effort = Survive + Wis or Cha modifier (min of 1).

Scene: Returned after 1 Scene. Indefinite: Returned once Art is instantly "turned off." Day: Returned after 1 Night's Rest.

**BIND COMPANION**: Main Action. W/ a day's work in a location, you can find & bind a suitable animal companion. If looking for a specific type of companion, it must be found in the area & may require a Wis/Survive Skill check at a DC ≥ 10 or more for a particularly rare creature. The creature is allowed a Mental Save to resist binding & become impervious to your powers. You may release a companion as a Main Action if you no longer wish its service or want to bind a different beast.

**BEAST WARD**: Effort: Indefinite. On Turn Action. While Committed the Beastmaster will not be attacked by unintelligent beasts unless the beast is commanded to do so by a master, the beast is starving, or the Beastmaster or their allies performs some hostile act against it. Once the ward ends or is broken, it can't be re-established in the same scene. Magical beasts & those trained specifically as guardians get a Mental Save to resist this power.

**EYES OF THE BEAST**: Effort: Scene. On Turn Action. Lasts 1 Scene. You can share the senses of your companion. Neither of you can be surprised unless both are surprised.

**FERAL TOUGHNESS**: Your max HP total is increased by the natural, unmodified HD of your companion(a 5HD companion increases your max HP by 5). You are impervious to normal outdoor extremes of heat or cold. Your base AC = 14 + ½ your level ↑. This AC can be modified by shields or Dex modifiers, but not by armor.

**HOWL OF DISTANT SUMMONS**: Effort: Day. Main Action. Extend a howl through time & space. The subject will have received the message in time to reach your side w/in 5 min. Once summoned, you may bind it again if you have no current companion. If the journey is exceptionally dangerous, difficult, or long, you'll need to make a Cha/Survive Skill check against a DC ≥ 10. On failure the beast could not make the journey & can't be called by this power for 1 wk.

**KNOW THE WEAK SPOT**: When inflicting damage on a beast w/ a weapon or physical attack, roll the damage x2 & take the higher. Optionally; Effort: Scene. Instant Action. When an ally w/in earshot hits a beast; your shouted assistance allows them to roll damage twice & take the better result as well.

**MIND CALL**: Effort: Scene. On Turn Action. Lasts 1 Scene. You forge a telepathic bond w/ your animal companion. You can give it orders & receive information from the creature, at least insofar as its limited intellect allows.

**NATURAL WEAPONRY**: Your unarmed attacks count as weapons. Attribute: Str or Dex, Skill: Punch or Stab, damage: 1d8, Shock: 2/AC 13. They can harm creatures immune to mundane weapons. Damage & Shock increase +1 @ level 3, +2 @ level 6, & +3 @ level 9.

**SAVAGE SENSES**: Effort: Scene. On Turn Action. Lasts 1 Scene. You are capable of seeing clearly even in pitch blackness, can scent out trails & belongings as perfectly as a wolf could, & gain a +2 on all Notice checks involving sight, sound, or smell.

**SHARED VITALITY**: Your bound animal companions have HD ≥ your level, even if normally fewer. Its hit bonus can't be < 1/2 its hit dice ↑. A Beastmaster can stabilize an Mortally Wounded companion by Committing Effort for the scene as an Instant Action.

**SWIFT HEALING**: Effort: Day. Main Action to heal 1d6 damage x character level to a wounded companion. This healing can be extended only 1/scene or 15 min.

**TONGUE OF THE BEASTS**: Effort: Indefinite. On Turn Action. While Commited you can speak w/ animals as if possessing human intellect, though their interests, knowledge, & desires do not change.

- Warlocks can't cast spells, but gain x2 as many Arts as is typical for a Partial Mage, earning 2 Arts at levels 3, 6, & 9.
- Warlock Arts are not hindered by the wearing of armor.

## Monsters and Encounters

**Judging an encounter challenge**

(Foe's Encounter's Total # of attacks) x (Foe's Encounter's Total # of HD) vs.(PC Party's Total # of Levels) x (# of PCs in the Party)

- If the Foe total is > 4 times larger, it will probably be a rout w/o excellent tactics, superb positioning, or some magic.
- If the Foe total is x2 as large, good chance of @ least 1 PC downed & possible TPK.
- If the Foe total is > the party total, the PCs might have an ally go down, but have a decent chance.
- If the Foe total is ≤ the party total, they're likely to win w/o anyone becoming Mortally Wounded.
- If the Foe total is < half the party total, it will probably be a walkover for the PCs

**MORALE CHECK**: 2d6 > ML = Fail. NPC retreats or surrenders.

**INSTINCT CHECK**: 1d10 ≤ Inst = Fail. The NPC behaves impulsively, short-sightedly, instinctually…

**SAVING THROW**: 1d20 < Save = Fail. The NPC fails the Save.
