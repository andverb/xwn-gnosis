## Modifications

- Adding Mods to gear requires Expert or Partial Expert, ≤ Craft+1, & sometimes rare "Esoteric Salvage" material - monster parts or other exotic components not available on general sale. 
- Takes 1 week x Mod's required level of Craft to install. ½ time w/ Craft-0 Assistant, or if all waking hours are spent working on the mod.
- Mods can Stack, but can't increase attack or damage bonus > +3 or Skill Check bonus > +1.
- Expert/Partial Expert can Maintain a # of Mods = Int + Con Modifiers + (3 x Craft Level).
- A modification requires maintenance every 24 hrs or it stops working (assumed to be done automatically by an expert/partial expert).
- If unmaintained for a 1 week item becomes unfit for use. After 1 yr it may become destroyed. Requires 1 hr of work to clean up a maintenance backlog.
