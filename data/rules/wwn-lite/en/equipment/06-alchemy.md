## Alchemical works

### Alchemy Basics
- Alchemy is a Skill restricted to Experts/Partial Experts. Others who take it gain only knowledge benefits.
- Concoctions created by alchemists are called Works & divided into Lesser & Greater.
- Making a Work requires ingredients, a formula, & a lab.
- Ingredients can be bought in town, looted from dungeons, or foraged in the wild (level x 10 $p of material for each day foraging).
- Formulae for listed works are common knowledge among alchemists. Others can be looted from tombs or bought @ shops.
- **Lesser lab**: Can be assembled w/in days, occupies ≥ an inn room's space, weighs 10Є packed, & can be packed/unpacked in 1hr.
- **Greater lab**: 5k $p to assemble, occupies 1 cottage's worth of space, is a cartload packed, & can be packed/unpacked in 1 day.

### Crafting Works
If the alchemist has a lab, formula, material, & time, they can attempt to craft a Work. Int/Craft check vs listed difficulty.

**On failure:** Alchemist chooses to accept the loss or push the reaction.
- **Accept the loss**: lose materials & time but nothing goes amiss.
- **Push the reaction**: Repeat the Skill check. Failure: Loss of time, material, & roll an Alchemical accident.

### Alchemical Accidents

**Roll 1d6:**
1. **Explosion**: 1d6 + DC dam, x2 for Greater Works. Lab destroyed.
2. **Fire**: 1d6 Dam, x2 for Greater Works. Lab useless for 1 wk.
3. **Poison**: Phys Save. Failure: Bedridden 1 wk. Success: +3 Strain.
4. **Stench**: Horrific odors render the lab unusable for 1 wk.
5. **Broken Tool**: That specific work can't be attempted again for 1 wk.
6. **Ordinary failure**: Only materials & time are lost.

### Using Alchemical Works
- Main Action. Range: 60'. If a Work requires direct application: attack vs AC. If thrown as a grenade: attack vs AC 12. On failure w/ grenade-like Works: Miss by 1d20 ft. 1d12 determines clock face direction of miss.
- Readied Work = 1Є. ≤4 Stowed Works = 1Є.
- Works w/ the same effect do not stack; only the strongest applies.
- Works are mundane & can't be detected, dispelled, resisted, or negated by anti-magical means.

### Lesser Works
These formulae are commonly known to Alchemists. The creation DC, materials cost, & time are listed.

**Acid Vial**: DC10. 50 $p. 1 day. Targeted. 1d4 damage. Physical or Mental Save. Failure = target loses their next Move Action from pain & panic. Can corrode tiny metal or wooden objects in about 15 mins.

**Binding Paste**: DC9. 50 $p. 1 day. The paste forms a rock hard bond between objects. Hardens in 1 Round, lasts for 1hr. The paste does not set if the objects are moving or flexing when applied.

**Blinding Dust**: DC9. 50 $p. 2 days. Targeted. Phys or Evasion Save. Failure: -4 to hit rolls & visual Skill checks for 1 scene. Creatures w/ ≥ 4HD make a Phys Save @ the end of their turns to end.

**Healing Salve**: DC7. 10 $p. 1 day. Regain 1.5x usual HP after a night's rest ↑. Frail creatures gain no benefit.

**Incandescent Dust**: DC9. 50 $p. 1 day. When thrown into a flame ≥ a torch it burns brilliantly for 1d6 Rounds illuminating everything w/in 50'. Anyone looking @ the fire makes a Phys Save or is dazzled for 1 Round (-4 penalty to hit rolls & AC).

**Inflammable Oil**: DC8. 100 $p. 1 day. A vial covers an object ≤ a large wood door. Cures w/in mins into a clear layer that ignites if struck. Flammable objects light on fire; non-flammable ones burn for 1 Round.

**Itching Dust**: DC9. 100 $p. 2 days. Targeted. Phys Save or suffer -2 to hit & AC for 1 scene. Creatures w/ ≥4HD make a Phys Save @ the end of their turns to ignore the itch for the rest of a fight.

**Luminescent Oil**: DC8. 50 $p. 1 day. A vial of this oil can cover 1 person or 10 torches. It causes an object to glow w/ a ghostly white light for 1hr barely sufficient to read by & adequate to make out the rough shapes of objects w/in 10'.

**Self-Igniting Oil**: DC8. 50 $p. 3 days. Thrown as a grenade. Creates a pool of flames, 5' in diameter, that burns for 2 Rounds. Those w/in it @ the start of their turn must move out or take 1d6 damage. It will ignite any flammable objects.

**Smoke Cloud**: DC9. 25 $p. 2 days. Thrown as a grenade that bursts into a cloud of smoke 10' in diameter. Lasts 1 Round. Ranged attacks through the smoke or melee attacks w/in it suffer -4 to hit, assuming attackers know roughly where their targets are.

**Soothing Powder**: DC8. 25 $p. 2 days. A drug that when consumed causes a helpless but very happy stupor for 1d6 hours. Phys Save to resist. Creatures w/ ≥4 HD make a Phys Save to throw off the effects when threatened.

**Touchstone**: DC10. 50 $p. 3 days. A prep'd alchemical kit w/ 1 use x alchemist's level. Can detect poisons & identify false precious metals or gems. Vs professional poisoners, the user makes an opposed Craft vs Heal Skill check in order to detect the toxin.

### Greater Works
These formulae are commonly known to Alchemists. Creation DC, materials cost, & time are listed.

**Aqueous Solvent**: DC11. 250 $p. 5 days. Unusable in combat; can melt through ≤ a fist-sized mass of metal/wood in < 1 min.

**Courage Elixir**: DC10. 200 $p. 1 wk. Potent analgesic. Adds 10 temp HP for 1 scene to the imbiber. The inability to feel pain leaves them unable to track their HP. At the scene's end, the phantom HP is lost & the user may end up Mortally Wounded.

**Infernal Wind**: DC11. 250 $p. 1 wk. Thrown as a grenade. Splatters in a 5' radius where it hits. Must be lit, then erupts into a cloud of black smoke. 1d6 damage to anyone in its area & creates a smoke cloud 10' in diameter. Ranged attacks through the smoke or melee attacks w/in it suffer -4 to hit, assuming attackers know roughly where targets are. Lasts for 1 Round x alchemist's level.

**Lethal Poison**: DC11. 500 $p. 1 wk. A small vial of clear, tasteless liquid strong enough to kill an ox w/in 1 min. Phys Save or take 1d6 damage x level of the alchemist. Damage takes effect 1d10 Rounds after consumption.

**Revivifying Draught**: DC10. 200 $p. 1 wk. Imbiber of this draught can exert themselves freely for 24hrs w/out need of rest. They physically can't sleep during this time. Draught adds 1 Strain. If used > 1/wk: Phys Save or suffer fatal heart attack.

**Sleeping Powders**: DC10. 200 $p. 3 days. Tasteless. When consumed causes intense drowsiness. If an imbiber feels threatened they can shake off the effects. If unawares: Phys Save @ penalty = to the Alchemist's Skill. Failure = fall asleep w/in 1 min.

**Sovereign Specific**: DC11. 200 $p. 1 wk. An imbiber suffering from poison can make a new save w/ a bonus = to the creator's Alchemy Skill. On a success, the poison's effects are negated. The specific must be used w/in 6 Rounds of the poisoning.

**Unquenchable Flame**: DC12. 1000 $p. 2 wks. This fist-sized mass is covered w/ a protective film. If scratched the mass will ignites & burn w/ a ferocious heat & toxic fumes for 1d6+4 Rounds. 1d6 damage to anyone who spends their full Round w/in 10'. The mass burns almost anything (stone, water, metal…) & often burns a hole 3' deep before consuming itself.
