### Druid Spells

### Level 1

#### Delude Beast
**Level:** 1  
Targets up to 1d6 beasts + 1 per caster level. Range: 100'. Duration: While the caster is present & 1 hour after departed. Beasts already in combat or in fear for their lives are unaffected. Mental Save. Failure = their senses are under the control of the caster, who can make them see, smell, or hear what they wish. If a delusion would put them in physical danger the spell breaks. The caster cannot change the illusions once they've left the target's presence.

#### Enthrall Beast
**Level:** 1  
**Requires:** a visible beast w/in 100'  
Mental Save. Failure = the beast becomes docile & obedient to the caster (obeys verbal orders w/ a human intellect so long as they are neither suicidal nor contrary to its nature). The beast will fight for the caster, provided the odds are not overwhelming. The caster can have a # of enthralled beasts = to their level or a total hit dice of beasts ≤ 2x the caster's level, whichever is fewer.

#### Seasonal Growth
**Level:** 1  
**Requires:** 1 hr to cast while the mage paces the boundaries of the area to be affected, ≤ 1 acre x caster level  
Once cast, the plant life w/in the area gains ≤ 1 yr of growth. This gain is uniform & indiscriminate. One acre of a peasant crop will yield enough to feed 2 people for 1 year, or 3 if the field is carefully prepared beforehand. This spell can't be cast again w/in a 1 mi radius until next spring.

#### Shape Plants
**Level:** 1  
Bend & shape or destroy all living, non magical plant material w/in 1 contiguous 10' cube x caster level. Requires 5 min to shape, but destruction of matter is instant. If used against plant-based monsters, the spell does 1d10 damage x caster level (Physical Save for ½). Cutting through magically shaped barriers takes 5hp x caster level of damage to cut a man-sized hole, & requires weapons suitable for chopping wood. The plants can be shaped w/ enough precision to make crude tools that have no moving parts.

#### Wood Ward
**Level:** 1  
**Requires:** 1 visible subject w/in 30' x caster level  
**Duration:** 1 scene  
Target becomes immune to non-magical wooden or wood-hafted weapons or implements, as well as plant-derived toxins, spores, or glues. This spell can cure poisonings or infestations.

---

### Level 2

#### Beast Pellet
**Level:** 2  
**Requires:** a dead, mostly-intact beast ≤ an ox & 1 week  
Magical spores cover the corpse, causing it to shrink to a marble sized pellet. The caster may hurl the pellet w/in 30' as a Main Action, whereupon the beast will reappear fully intact, albeit undead. It obeys the caster's spoken commands w/ human intellect & suicidal devotion. The beast withers away to dust 1 hr after summoning. The caster may have no more pellets at once than their level, & each pellet they carry subtracts 1 point from their maximum System Strain.

#### Beast Shape
**Level:** 2  
The caster may adopt the outward semblance of any normal beast or plant < an ox & > a mouse. They gain the movement rating of the beast & its ability to breathe water or endure natural temperature extremes, but the caster's other statistics, senses, or unarmed attacks are unchanged. Any worn or held equipment merges w/ the beast form & continues to confer its usual AC or weapon statistics; the caster cannot change gear or drop items until the spell ends. Lasts until dispelled, next dawn, or ended as an On Turn action.

#### Sickles of Bone
**Level:** 2  
**Requires:** ≤ 1 willing target x caster level  
Range 30'. Targets grow long, sharp claws of bone for 1 hr x caster level. Targets are capable of clawing 2 in/min through plant matter. These claws do not hinder the user's dexterity, but count as magical weapons (1d8 damage, Shock 2/15, attribute = Str or Dex). If the caster is the target, they may use Magic instead of Stab or Punch as the combat skill. If cast on a creature that already has claws, fangs, or other natural weapons (not including unarmed-trained humans) the creature gains a bonus to damage rolls & Shock equal to the caster's level.

#### Trace the Path
**Level:** 2  
The caster must focus on the image of a person or a type of creature when casting this spell. The plant life around the mage immediately telepathically directs the caster in the direction of whatever creature last fit the description, provided the tracked target would be perceptible to human senses. The plant life continues to lead the caster for up to 1hr x level, though the spell ends at dusk or when the caster casts another spell.

---

### Level 3

#### Beast Ward
**Level:** 3  
Caster must pace off an area ≤ 1 acre x level, or spend a Main Action indicating a straight line ≤ 40' long w/in 100'. Wild beasts will not cross into the warded area or pass the indicated line unless permitted by the caster. Creatures who somehow end up in the area will think of nothing but fleeing it. Area wards persist as long as the caster remains inside them. Line wards or abandoned areas cease to protect 1 hr x level afterwards. Beasts incapable of feeling fear are unaffected by this spell.

#### Feral Bargain
**Level:** 3  
This spell does not function in combat, & must be cast on a beast w/in 50' of the caster. The spell immediately opens a telepathic link w/ the target, after which the caster must offer something that the beast would reasonably want in exchange for a service from the beast. Even a hostile creature will spend a few mins parlaying unless directly threatened, & will negotiate w/ a human level of intelligence. If the mage can offer a suitable price for the creature's cooperation, the bargain will be made & the creature will be bound to perform it w/ human intelligence if they are capable of doing it & it is not suicidally dangerous. If the caster fails to keep their end of the bargain under the same terms, however, they must make a Mental save to avoid immediate death from the psychic backlash.

#### Plant Walk
**Level:** 3  
**Requires:** a willing target w/in 30' touching a plant of a volume ≥ their body  
Once cast, the spell's recipient disappears into the plant. As a Main Action, they can step out of any plant of similar or larger size w/in 100' x caster level. Optionally, they can instead cast their senses to such a target plant & observe their surroundings as if standing there. Lasts 15 min or ends when the subject steps out of a plant. Damage inflicted on a plant while the subject is hiding in it is done to them as well.

---

### Level 4

#### Force Beast Shape
**Level:** 4  
Functions as Beast Shape but can target even an unwilling creature w/in 100' (Physical save negates). If the creature is of a level > the caster, it rolls its Save w/ Advantage. The shifted creature retains its own stats, but drops its possessions when it changes. Lasts until dispelled or ended. Each week spent as an animal they must succeed a Mental save or succumb to the beast's nature & forget their prior life forever, gaining the attributes of the natural animal. If killed in animal shape they remain an animal in death.

#### Harmonious Passage
**Level:** 4  
**Affects:** the caster & up to 3 other visible allies x caster level  
So long as the spell is maintained, those protected are immune to plant or animal derived toxins or spores & are considered inedible by beasts, who will ignore them unless greatly provoked. They leave no mundanely-perceptible trace of their passage over unpaved earth & are immune to inclement weather, provided the atmosphere is not outright unsurvivable. Lasts until dawn, or until a subject voluntarily harms a beast or large plant.

---

### Level 5

#### Claim Domain
**Level:** 5  
**Requires:** 5 hrs & a full moon  
Once cast, all the land w/in 1 mi x caster level is accounted part of the caster's domain. W/in this space, beasts will obey them w/ human intelligence in any way not contrary to their nature. The caster may speak w/ animals & plants w/in this area as if they had human intellect. They will also become intuitively aware of the location of any groups > 24 people traveling or living together. This domain cannot overlap w/ a prior caster's domain, & it has no power w/in the walls or boundary markers of human settlements or cities. A caster may maintain only 1 domain at a time.

#### Rend Structure
**Level:** 5  
Range 200'. Affects only non magical structures. Plantlife erupts from the surface of the structure, their roots ripping it apart w/in 6 secs. The spell can affect only 1 structure or wall segment at a time & destroy no more than a 100' cube of it. The caster has very fine control of the demolition & can destroy only selective smaller parts of a structure, or prevent the demolition from harming those in or around the building. If not so careful, anyone w/in the structure takes 10d6 damage (Evasion save for ½).

**Starting # of Spells Known**: 2  

**Starting Arts**: Shadow Play + Any One  

**Max Effort**: Int or Cha modifier + Magic Skill  

**Spell Lists**: High Mage, Illusionist  


### Arts of the Illusionists

- Scene: Returned after 1 Scene.
- Indefinite: Returned once Art is instantly "turned off."
- Day: Returned after 1 Night's Rest.

Cannot cast spells in armor or w/ a shield. Arts are subtle & require no obvious gestures or words.

#### Shadow Play
**Effort:** None  
**Main Action**  
Create small phantasms, spectral sounds, & limited olfactory/tactile impressions. Obviously illusionary; can't conceal objects or meaningfully deceive. Range: 10'. Lasts while you keep using this art.

#### Command Attention
**Effort:** Day  
**Move Action**  
Distract a visible creature. On a failed Mental Save, its attention is entirely on you for 1 Round & it's oblivious to everything else unless directly threatened. Doesn't work once combat has begun.

#### Dazzling Lights
**Effort:** Day  
**On Turn Action**  
**Limit:** 1/Round  
Conjure brilliant lights, smoke, or other distractions concealing you & everything within 5' for 1 Round. You & those inside see clearly; opaque to those outside.

#### False End
**Effort:** Day  
**Instant Action**  
When you or a visible willing ally is injured but not killed or Mortally Wounded, create a True Illusion of their dramatic death lasting up to 1 hr. Objects taken from the "corpse" vanish when the art ends. Ends if the "victim" acts or suffers further injury.

#### Ghost Light
**Effort:** Indefinite  
**Main Action**  
A sourceless light illumines everything within 30' of you. Only you & up to ~6 companions can see it.

#### Masked Token
**Effort:** Day  
**Move Action**  
While holding an object < 5 lbs, transform it into any other object of similar weight. Lasts 1 hr/level. Careful inspection: Mental Save breaks the effect.

#### Pierce the Veil
**Effort:** None  
Automatically detect illusions & see invisible objects. Doesn't help notice creatures using conventional Stealth, & doesn't let you see *through* an illusion — only recognize it as false.

#### Sensory Excision
**Effort:** Day  
**Main Action**  
Allow a willing ally in sight to completely ignore 1 sensory input for the scene (e.g., pain, exhaustion, thirst). If pain is ignored: ally can act @ 0 HP, but further damage kills instead of Mortally Wounding. Doesn't prevent spellcasting disruption from injury.

#### Share Senses
**Effort:** Day  
**Move Action**  
Target a visible creature (Mental Save resists; on success they sense mental magic was used). If unresisted, you sense everything the target senses until end of scene or until dropped. You are oblivious to your own senses while active.

#### Showmanship
**Effort:** None  
Use your Magic skill in place of any Perform skill check or requirement. If you already have Perform, trade it for a different skill @ equal level.

#### Splendid Aspect
**Effort:** Indefinite  
**On Turn Action**  
While Committed, appear dressed, coiffed, & adorned however you choose, @ any apparent age. Perfectly convincing to all senses; physical statistics unchanged.

#### Thunderous Roar
**Effort:** Scene  
**Move Action**  
Create a sound of your choice within 50'. Audible up to 50' x caster level away. Lasts & can be changed as long as you spend a Move Action each turn. Known voices can be mimicked. Fine control: Cha/Perform check @ GM-set difficulty.

#### Wizard's Pocket
**Effort:** Indefinite  
**Move Action**  
While holding an object < 5 lbs, it disappears until Effort is reclaimed (counts as 1 Stowed enc while displaced). Automatically reappears in hand if you die or are targeted by Extirpate Arcana.

---

### True Illusions

All Illusionist spells that create True Illusions share these rules:

- **Physically real**: Fully tangible — True Illusionary fire burns, walls can be climbed, creatures can be fought.
- **No lasting effects**: All effects end when the spell does. Slain foes rise unhurt, burnt objects reconstitute.
- **Can't subtract reality**: Can add walls, creatures, objects. Can't create holes, pits, or remove existing things.
- **Stability**: Each True Illusion has Stability = caster's Magic skill + 1. When reduced to 0, the illusion ends. Spells specify when Stability is risked (Mental Saves, taking damage, close inspection). Willing participants may choose not to save.

Movement under a True Illusion still counts in reality. A creature carried in an illusionary cart is still wherever it was left; one who climbed an illusionary ladder onto solid ground stays there.

### Illusionist Spells

#### The Inward Eye

**Instant Action**  
Become impervious to the Make a Swarm Attack maneuver. Your assailants cannot use this maneuver against you for the rest of the scene, & you become immune to Shock as long as you remain in melee w/ ≥ 2 foes. Making use of this benefit disrupts any spellcasting you may attempt, however, due to the violent motion required.

#### Nimble Ascent
**Effort:** Scene  
**On Turn Action**  
For the remainder of the scene you may move up vertical & overhanging surfaces & across difficult terrain at your full movement rate w/ no chance of slipping or falling, provided the surface is not glass-smooth or enchanted. You require only one free hand to cling to a wall or ceiling.

#### Revivifying Breath
**Effort:** Day  
**On Turn Action**  
**Limit:** 1/scene  
Heal yourself for 1d6 hp + your level. This healing does not increase Strain. This ability may be used on your turn even when you are at 0 hp, but in such a case it Commits all your remaining Effort for the day.

#### Shattering Strike
**Effort:** Day  
Requires 1 full round of motionlessness to prepare. On the next round, as a Main Action, your unarmed attack can shatter a wooden door, wooden wall, or other similar object up to a depth of 1' x level & a width sufficient to allow a man-sized creature to pass through. At 4th level this ability improves to affect even a stone wall & at 7th it can affect even a metal wall or solid iron door. The blow is useless against a target that can move, but against an immobilized creature the attack does 1d12 damage x level.

#### Style Weaponry
Pick 3 general classes of weapons (swords, bows, axes, daggers, etc). When using weapons of those classes, you may use Punch for hit rolls instead of Stab or Shoot.
