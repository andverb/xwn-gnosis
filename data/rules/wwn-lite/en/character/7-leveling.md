## Character Advancement

### Leveling Up
When a PC has accumulated enough xp to advance a level they achieve the following:

- Increase attack Bonus according to your Class.
- Gain Arts according to your Class (if any).
- Full Mages add 2 spells to their grimoire, half-Mages that cast spells add 1.
- Gain New Foci @ levels 2, 5, 7, & 10. **Foci that grant Skills grant 3 SP to invest into corresponding skill instead**.
- Increase HP. Roll 1d6 + Class HP Adjustment + Con Mod for each Level. Minimum for each roll is 1, even with negative Con mod. If sum of rolls is greater than your max. HP, this is your new max. HP, otherwise +1 to your max HP.
- PC Saves decrease by 1 (Saves = 16 - character Level - Best Relevant Attr).
- Gain 3 SP to save or spend on improving Skills or Attr. Full & Partial Experts gain +1 SP to spend on a non-combat Skill.

### Spending Skill Points
- The cost to boost a Skill = the Skill's new value + 1.
- Attribute Score boost cost 1SP for the 1st, 2SP for the 2nd… Max of 5 boosts.
