## Step 4: Choose Foci

- Choose your Foci according to your class table
- Some Foci raise Skill (-1 to -0, -0 to +1…) Can't raise a Skill past Level+1 @ character creation. Choose a different Skill (not Magic).
- After Creation, instead of Foci raising Skills by tiers, Foci grant 3 Skill Points towards future purchase of the Skills next tier.
- After Creation, Foci can raise Skills past PC Level Caps. Skill+4 Max. @ Skill+4 choose another Skill to apply Points towards.
- A Warrior Foci is any the GM deems. An Expert Foci is any the GM deems.

#### ASSASSIN

**Level 1**: Gain any combat Skill. You can use knife-sized thrown weapons in melee w/o suffering penalties for the proximity of melee attackers.
