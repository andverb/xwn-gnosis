## Monsters & Encounters

### Judging an encounter challenge

(Foe's Encounter's Total # of attacks) x (Foe's Encounter's Total # of HD) vs.(PC Party's Total # of Levels) x (# of PCs in the Party)

- If the Foe total is > 4 times larger, it will probably be a rout w/o excellent tactics, superb positioning, or some magic.
- If the Foe total is x2 as large, good chance of @ least 1 PC downed & possible TPK.
- If the Foe total is > the party total, the PCs might have an ally go down, but have a decent chance.
- If the Foe total is ≤ the party total, they're likely to win w/o anyone becoming Mortally Wounded.
- If the Foe total is < half the party total, it will probably be a walkover for the PCs

**MORALE CHECK**: 2d6 > ML = Fail. NPC retreats or surrenders.

**INSTINCT CHECK**: 1d10 ≤ Inst = Fail. The NPC behaves impulsively, short-sightedly, instinctually…

**SAVING THROW**: 1d20 < Save = Fail. The NPC fails the Save.
