## Developing New Spells

- Int/Magic check = DC10 + Spell's Level. Magic-0 Apprentice: +1 bonus. Mage researching New Magic of their specialty: +1 bonus.
- On success the spell is created. On failure the initial time & money is lost & PCs must roll on the Formula Flaw table.
- PCs decide to quit or continue w/ the flawed spell, spending ½ the original time, no additional coin, & gaining a +1 bonus.
- PCs can repeat this process adding flaws & paying ½ the original time until successful or until they abandon the project.

**Spell design guidelines:**

- Spells should not substitute for other classes.
- Spells should not offer simple numeric bonuses.
- Spells should not offer cheap & easy combat damage.
- Spells that buff a target shouldn't last > a scene.
- Spells should not create permanent magical effects or valuable matter.
- Spells should not be petty.

### Spell Development Costs

| SPELL LEVEL | LAB FEE | MATERIAL FEE* | TIME COST |
|-------------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Level 1 | 50k $p | 25k $p | 1 month |
| Level 2 | 125k $p | 50k $p | 2 months |
| Level 3 | 250k $p | 100k $p | 4 months |
| Level 4 | 500k $p | 200k $p | 8 months |
| Level 5 | 1m $p | 400k $p | 2 years |

*x2 Material Fee = ½ Time

### Formula Flaws

**Roll 1d10:**  
1. The spell can only target the caster.  
2. The spell only works on willing targets.  
3. The formula is unchanged, but you gain no cumulative +1 bonus on the research roll for this or prior research continuations.  
4. The spell can only target people other than the caster.  
5. The spell is slow & requires a Main Action to cast (2 Main Actions over 2 successive Rounds if it already required a Main Action).  
6. The spell is very draining, exhausting 2 spells worth of energy for the day instead of 1.  
7. The spell inflicts 1d4 Strain when cast. If this maxes their Strain they fall unconscious for 10 min.  
8. The spell is 1 level > expected (does not increase research costs or time). The project fails if unable to cast a spell of that level.  
9. The spell is simply unreliable. When cast, roll 1d6. On a 1, the spell fizzles uselessly & the casting slot is wasted.  
10. The whole attempt was a mistake. All progress & research materials are lost & everything must be done over from the start.
