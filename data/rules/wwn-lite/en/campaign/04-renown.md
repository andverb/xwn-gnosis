## Renown & Projects

Renown is earned through deeds & used to complete Major Projects. A party earns a point of Renown each session they successfully:

- Accomplish a longstanding goal.
- Aid those in dire need.
- Best a major foe.
- Risk grave danger for glory or fortune.

Alternatively, the GM may award Renown at the end of each session on a 0–2 scale: 0 if the party left no impression on the world around them; 1 by default; 2 if they meaningfully increased their influence or engaged with the broader campaign world.

### Major Projects
A Project's Renown Cost = Probability x Scope x Opposition.
Characters can combine their renown to accomplish common projects.

| GOAL PROBABILITY | SCOPE AFFECTED | GREATEST OPPOSITION |
|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Plausible (1 Renown) | Village (x2) | Minor figures (x2) |
| Improbable (2 Renown) | City (x4) | Local leaders (x4) |
| Impossible (4 Renown) | Region (x8) | Major noble or beast (x8) |
| | Kingdom (x16) | King or famed monster (x16) |

*Multiply opposition by x2 if the local population is emotionally or socially against it.

**Cost can be lowered by influencing the probability, adjusting the scope, or nullifying the opposition.

### Buying Renown

Renown can also be purchased with silver pieces at increasing cost.

| RENOWN BOUGHT | COST IN SP PER POINT |
|---------------|----------------------|
| First 1–4 points | 500 sp per point |
| Next 4 points | 2,000 sp per point |
| Next 8 points | 4,000 sp per point |
| Next 16 points | 8,000 sp per point |
| Next 32 points | 16,000 sp per point |
| Next 64 points | 32,000 sp per point |
| Further points | Prohibitively expensive |

*Example: purchasing 14 points costs 2,000 (first four) + 8,000 (next four) + 24,000 (next six) = 34,000 sp total.*
