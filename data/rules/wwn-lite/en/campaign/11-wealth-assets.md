### Asset Descriptions

#### Armed Guards
Hired caravan guards, bodyguards, or other armed minions serve the faction.

#### Cooperative Businesses
If another faction creates an Asset at this location, the cost increases by 1 Treasure. This penalty stacks.

#### Farmers
Farmers, hunters, and simple artisans. Free action, once per turn: roll 1d6; on 5+, gain 1 Treasure.

#### Front Merchant
On a successful Attack, the target faction loses 1 Treasure (if any) and the Front Merchant's owner gains it. Only once per turn.

#### Caravan
Free action, once per turn: spend 1 Treasure to move itself and one other Asset at the same location to a new location within one move.

#### Dragomans
Interpreters and cultural specialists. A faction taking Expand Influence at this location rolls an extra die on all checks there that turn. Free action, once per turn: move this Asset.

#### Pleaders
Legal specialists who turn local laws against the faction's enemies. Cannot Attack or inflict Counterattack damage on Force Assets.

#### Worker Mob
The roughest, most brutal laborers organized to discipline the faction's enemies.

#### Ancient Mechanisms
A magical mechanism from ages past refitted for industry. Whenever an Asset in the same location must roll to make a profit (e.g., Farmers, Manufactory), roll twice and take the better result.

#### Arcane Laboratory
The faction's Magic is counted as one step higher for creating Assets at this location. Multiple Laboratories in the same location stack.

#### Free Company
Hired mercenaries. Free action, once per turn: move itself. Requires 1 Treasure upkeep at the start of each turn; if unpaid, roll 1d6: on 1-3 the Asset is lost, on 4-6 it goes rogue and attacks the most profitable target. Repeated each turn until paid or lost.

#### Manufactory
Free action, once per turn: roll 1d6. On 1, lose 1 Treasure; on 2-5, gain 1; on 6, gain 2. If Treasure is lost and none available by end of turn, this Asset is lost.

#### Healers
Whenever an Asset within one move is destroyed by a Force-based Attack, the owner may pay half the destroyed Asset's purchase cost (rounded up) to instantly restore it with 1 HP. Cannot restore Bases of Influence.

#### Monopoly
Free action, once per turn: target an Asset in the same location. Its owning faction must pay 1 Treasure or lose the targeted Asset.

#### Occult Countermeasures
Can only Attack or inflict Counterattack damage on Assets that require at least Low Magic to purchase.

#### Usurers
For each Usurers unit owned, Asset purchase costs may be decreased by 2 Treasure (minimum half cost). Each use inflicts 1d4 damage on the Usurers from popular displeasure.

#### Mad Genius
Free action, once per turn: move. Free action, once per turn: sacrifice the Mad Genius to treat the Magic rating at this location as High for purchasing Assets. Boost lasts only until the next Asset is purchased there.

#### Smuggling Fleet
Free action, once per turn: move itself and one Asset at the same location to any water-accessible location within one move. The co-moved Asset gains Subtle until it takes an action at the destination.

#### Supply Interruption
Free action, once per turn: make a Cunning vs. Wealth check against an Asset in the same location. On success, the owning faction must pay Treasure equal to half the target's purchase cost or the target is disabled until paid.

#### Economic Disruption
Free action, once per turn: move itself without cost.

#### Merchant Prince
Free action, once per turn (before buying a new Asset in the same location): the Merchant Prince takes 1d4 damage and the purchased Asset costs 1d8 Treasure less (minimum half normal price).

#### Trade Company
Bold traders. Free action, once per turn: accept 1d4 damage to earn 1d6-1 Treasure.
