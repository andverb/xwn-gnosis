### Asset Descriptions

#### Fearful Intimidation
Judicious exercises of force intimidate the locals, making them reluctant to cooperate with any group opposed to the faction.

#### Local Guard
Ordinary citizens enlisted into night watch patrols and local guard units. Most effective defending from fortified positions.

#### Summoned Hunter
A sorcerer has summoned a magical beast or mentally bound a disposable assassin into the faction's service.

#### Thugs
Gutter ruffians and common kneebreakers organized in service to the faction.

#### Guerrilla Populace
Locals aided by trained guerrilla warfare leaders who help them sabotage and attack unwary hostiles.

#### Military Transport
Skilled teamsters, transport ships, or road-building crews. Free action, once per turn: bring an allied Asset within one move to this location, or move an allied Asset from this location to a target within one move. Multiple Military Transports can chain movement over long distances.

#### Reserve Corps
Retired military personnel and rear-line troops spread through the area as workers or colonists, available to resist hostilities.

#### Scouts
Long-range scouts and reconnaissance experts able to venture deep into hostile territory.

#### Enchanted Elites
Carefully-selected skilled warriors given magical armaments and arcane blessings to boost their effectiveness.

#### Infantry
Common foot soldiers organized and armed by the faction. Not particularly heroic, but numerous.

#### Temple Fanatics
Fanatical servants of a cult, ideology, or religion who wreak havoc without thought for their own lives. After every time they defend or successfully attack, they take 1d4 damage.

#### Witch Hunters
Personnel trained in detecting traitors, spies, hostile magic, and hidden spellcraft within the organization.

#### Cavalry
Mounted troops, chariots, or other mobile soldiers. Weak on defense, but can harry logistics and mount powerful charges.

#### Military Roads
A network of roads with logistical stockpiles. Once per turn: move any one Asset from any location within reach to any other location within reach for 1 Treasure.

#### Vanguard Unit
Specially trained to build bridges, reduce fortifications, and facilitate lightning strikes. During a Relocate Asset action, it can move itself and any allied units at the same location to any location within range, even if the unit type would normally be prohibited. Relocated units may remain there even if the Vanguard Unit leaves.

#### War Fleet
Can only Attack assets and locations reachable by waterways. Once per turn, can freely relocate to any coastal area within movement range. Must be based at a landward location for supply and refitting.

#### Demonic Slayer
An inhuman assassin-beast summoned or constructed by powerful sorcerers to hunt the faction's enemies. Enters play Stealthed.

#### Magical Logistics
An advanced web of magical Workings, skilled sorcerers, and logistical experts. Free action, once per turn: repair 2 HP of damage to an allied Force Asset.

#### Siege Experts
Soldiers trained in trenching, sapping, and razing. On a successful Attack, the target's owner loses 1d4 Treasure and this faction gains it.

#### Fortification Program
Organized fortification and supply caching around the Asset's location. Once per turn, when an enemy Attacks targeting the faction's Force, the Fortification Program can defend if it is within one move of the attack.

#### Knights
Elite warriors of considerable personal prowess — noble sympathizers, veteran members, or amenable mercenaries.

#### War Machines
Mobile war machines driven by trained beasts or magical motive power.

#### Brilliant General
A leader for the ages. Whenever the Brilliant General or any allied Force Asset in the same location Attacks or defends, it rolls an extra die.

#### Purity Rites
Rigorous mental inspection and counterintelligence measures. Can only defend against attacks targeting the faction's Cunning, but grants an extra die to defend.

#### Warshaped
Magical creatures designed for warfare, or greatly altered humans. Few and elusive enough to evade easy detection.

#### Apocalypse Engine
A hideously powerful ancient super-weapon unearthed from a lost armory, raining eldritch horror on targeted enemies.

#### Invincible Legion
A truly irresistible military organization. During a Relocate Asset action, can move to locations that would normally prohibit formal military forces, as if it had the Subtle quality. It is not, however, in any way subtle.
