### Asset Descriptions

#### Informers
Free action, once per turn: spend 1 Treasure to search for Stealthed Assets. Pick a faction and make a Cunning vs. Cunning attack. No counterattack on failure. On success, all Stealthed Assets of that faction within one move are revealed.

#### Petty Seers
Skilled fortune-tellers and minor oracles foresee perils and enable swift counterattacks.

#### Smugglers
Free action, once per turn: move any allied Wealth or Cunning Asset in same location to a destination within movement range, even if the destination wouldn't normally allow a non-Subtle Asset.

#### Useful Idiots
Disposable minions. If another Asset within one move is struck by an Attack, sacrifice the Useful Idiots to negate the attack entirely. Only one band of Useful Idiots can be sacrificed per turn.

#### Blackmail
Hostile factions in the same location can't roll more than one die during Attacks made by or against them there, even if tags or Assets normally grant bonus dice.

#### Dancing Girls
Immune to Attack or Counterattack damage from Force Assets, but cannot defend against Force Asset Attacks.

#### Hired Friends
Free action, once per turn: spend 1 Treasure to grant a Wealth Asset within one move the Subtle quality. Lasts until the Hired Friends are destroyed or use this ability again.

#### Saboteurs
An Asset Attacked by Saboteurs can't use any free action abilities during the next turn, whether or not the Attack succeeded.

#### Bewitching Charmer
On a successful Attack, the targeted Asset cannot leave the Charmer's location until the Charmer moves or is destroyed. Immune to Counterattack.

#### Covert Transport
Free action, once per turn: pay 1 Treasure to move any Cunning or Wealth Asset at the same location. The transported Asset gains Stealth until it performs an action or is otherwise used.

#### Occult Infiltrators
Magically-gifted spies and assassins. Always begin play with the Stealth quality.

#### Spymaster
A veteran operative runs a counterintelligence bureau in the area.

#### Court Patronage
Automatically grants 1 Treasure to its owning faction each turn.

#### Idealistic Thugs
Easily-manipulated hotheads enlisted under whatever ideological or religious principle best enthuses them for violence.

#### Seditionists
Instead of an Attack action: spend 1d4 Treasure and attach to a hostile Asset in the same location. Until destroyed, infesting another Asset, or leaving, the target Asset cannot be used for anything and grants no benefits.

#### Vigilant Agents
Whenever another faction moves a Stealthed Asset into a location within one move, Vigilant Agents may make a Cunning vs. Cunning attack against the owning faction. On success, the intruding Asset loses Stealth after completing the move.

#### Cryptomancers
Instead of an Attack action: make a Cunning vs. Cunning attack on a specific hostile Asset within one move. On success, the target can't do anything or be used on its owner's next turn. No Counterattack on failure.

#### Organization Moles
Sleeper agents and deep-cover spies burrowed into hostile organizations, waiting to disrupt them from within when ordered.

#### Shapeshifters
Free action, once per turn: spend 1 Treasure to grant the Shapeshifters the Stealth quality.

#### Interrupted Logistics
Non-Stealthed hostile units cannot enter the same location without paying 1d4 Treasure and waiting one turn to arrive.

#### Prophet
A religious prophet, charismatic philosopher, rebel leader, or other figure of popular appeal firmly under the faction's control.

#### Underground Roads
A network of secret transit extending far around this Asset. Free action: pay 1 Treasure to move any friendly Asset from a location within one move of the Roads to a destination within one move of the Roads.

#### Expert Treachery
On a successful Attack: this Asset is lost, owning faction gains 5 Treasure, and the targeted Asset switches sides. The conversion happens even if the new owners lack the attributes normally required for that Asset.

#### Mindbenders
Free action, once per turn: force a rival faction to reroll a check, Attack, or other die roll and take whichever result the Mindbenders prefer. A faction can only be affected this way once until the start of the Mindbender's faction's next turn.

#### Popular Movement
Any friendly Asset may move into the Popular Movement's location, even if normally forbidden and lacking Subtle. If the Popular Movement later moves or is destroyed, such Assets must also leave or suffer the usual consequences for a non-Subtle Asset.

#### Just As Planned
Whenever the faction's Assets make a Cunning roll, they may reroll a failed check at the cost of inflicting 1d6 damage on Just As Planned. May be done repeatedly (possibly destroying it). No range limit.

#### Omniscient Seers
At the start of their turn, each hostile Stealthed Asset within one move must succeed in a Cunning vs. Cunning check against the owning faction or lose Stealth. All Cunning rolls by the faction for units or events within one move of the Seers gain an extra die.
