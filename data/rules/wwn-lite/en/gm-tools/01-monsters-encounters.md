## Monsters & Encounters

### Judging an encounter challenge

(Foe's Encounter's Total # of attacks) x (Foe's Encounter's Total # of HD) vs.(PC Party's Total # of Levels) x (# of PCs in the Party)

- If the Foe total is > 4 times larger, it will probably be a rout w/o excellent tactics, superb positioning, or some magic.
- If the Foe total is x2 as large, good chance of @ least 1 PC downed & possible TPK.
- If the Foe total is > the party total, the PCs might have an ally go down, but have a decent chance.
- If the Foe total is ≤ the party total, they're likely to win w/o anyone becoming Mortally Wounded.
- If the Foe total is < half the party total, it will probably be a walkover for the PCs

**MORALE CHECK**: 2d6 > ML = Fail. NPC retreats, surrenders, or seeks to escape.

Roll when:
- **First casualty** — First member of a group is killed or incapacitated
- **Losing badly** — Group starts to visibly lose or odds of victory shrink
- **Terror** — Facing terrifying magic, horrendous slaughter, or vastly superior foe
- **Non-combatant** — Civilian first faced with serious physical harm
- **Ambush** — Undisciplined targets may check when ambushed (GM discretion)

On failure:
- **Non-combatants:** Flee madly, drop everything
- **Trained fighters:** Fighting withdrawal, try to escape with comrades
- **If escape impossible:** Surrender, collapse in despair, or fight with frenzy

*Typical ML: 2–5 cowardly, 6–7 average, 8–9 brave, 10–11 fearless, 12 unbreakable. PCs never check.*

---

**INSTINCT CHECK**: 1d10 ≤ Inst = Fail. NPC acts impulsively, short-sightedly, instinctually.

Roll when:
- **Round 2+** — Second round of combat for mobs and undisciplined fighters
- **After Morale** — Creature just had to make a Morale check
- **Confusion** — Enemy did something confusing or disorienting
- **Provoked** — Enemy enraged or directly intimidated the creature
- **Temptation** — Presented with something it desires (food, money, etc.)

On failure examples: attack wrong target, use unarmed instead of weapon, chase dropped bait, shoot at lesser targets.

*Typical Inst: 5+ beasts/civilians, 3–4 veterans, 1–2 hardened, 0 coldest killers. PCs never check. Optional rule.*

**SAVING THROW**: 1d20 < Save = Fail. The NPC fails the Save.
